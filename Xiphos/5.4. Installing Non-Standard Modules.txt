5.4. Installing Non-Standard Modules
http://xiphos.org/manual/module-manager

Some resource modules in Sword Project format are available from sources other than Crosswire and not from a module manager-ready repository. Necessarily, installing such a module is a manual task.

Modules are normally packaged as *.zip files; they contain a configuration file plus a number of data files. Installation of such a module is done by cd'ing to your personal Sword (not Xiphos) configuration directory, ~/.sword, and unzipping the file there. The configuration file will be left in "mods.d", and the module's data files will go into a subdirectory of "modules". Alternatively, if you have write access to the system Sword directory, typically /usr/share/sword, you may cd there instead before unzipping.

Restart Xiphos after installing such a module, so that a fresh instance of the program can notice the new module in place.
