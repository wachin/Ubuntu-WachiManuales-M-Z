1. Install imagemagick from Ubuntu Software Center

    Or, in the terminal:

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick

2. Put all your image files in a single directory.

3. Open a terminal and go to this directory:

cd <directory-location>

4. Now, enter following command to resize all of the images to a specific percentage. For examples, for the following command, all of the images will be reduced to 50% of their dimension maintaining the ratio.

mogrify -resize 50% -format jpg *

Where -format jpg specifies: the resultant format will be JPG.

You may also specify width and height by the following command:

mogrify -resize 800x600 -format jpg *

You can easily guess, the resultant images will be of width 800 px and height of 600 px, keeping the original ratio. Full documentation here:
