Resume playback

VLC 2.2.0 lets you resume playback on the desktop.
Another nice addition in VLC 2.2.0 is the ability to resume playback—a feature that’s been on mobile versions for some time and is now on the desktop. When you open a video file you were watching previously, you’ll see a small toolbar below the VLC menu giving you the option to resume from where you left off.
