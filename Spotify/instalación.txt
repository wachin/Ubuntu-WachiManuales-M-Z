Spotify for Linux
https://www.spotify.com/es/download/linux/ 

Here you can find a build of Spotify for Linux. We are running this ourselves and we will try to make sure it keeps pace with its Mac and Windows siblings. However, this version is unsupported. You can tell us what you think and ask other users for help at The Spotify Community.

Spotify for Linux is released as a Debian package. It should work with the latest Long Term Support release of Ubuntu (currently 14.04), but we try to support later and earlier releases of Ubuntu and Debian.
