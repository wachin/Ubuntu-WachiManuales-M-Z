Like Jimmy said, doing a virtual installation is fine (something like
Virtualbox). But, for live processing (both audio and video), you will
need to use actual hardware. And for that, booting the live ISO works,
all though there's an extra dimension to everything once you install and
have user settings for stuff.
So, I guess you have those two options 1) use something like Virtualbox
for an actual installation 2) boot the live ISO on a real machine to
test applications that require more processing power.

In short, get yourself a launchpad account at http://launchpad.net, and
when you find a bug, use a terminal. Input the command(replace
<packagename> with the name of the package you want to report against):

ubuntu-bug <packagename>

Knowing which package to report against can be difficult. This section
deals a bit with that -
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/Testing/ISOTesting#If_you_find_bugs.
But,  that page is mainly purposed for how to do the final smoke test of
the ISO for each milestone -  when we report our results at
http://iso.qa.ubunty.com. So, just skip any notions about that, for now,
and focus on the bug reporting part - if you find any.

Thanks for showing interest, and hope to see you around more in the
future. Testing is a good way to get involved in the development
process, which is something that anyone can participate in.
