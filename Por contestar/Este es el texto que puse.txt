I have the next problem. I found a icon theme very good called "Suru++" 


[Suru++ 20 \[Officially bug-free and 11 DEs-compatible\]][1]

But this icon theme are made in svg all image. Now I want to use it in Fluxbox and generate menu entries but this only is possible with png icon image
I download the [master][2] inside that are all icons in svg format, and yes I can convert from command line svg to png all ok generate for each folder size like 16x16, 24x24 px. But in that folders are symbolic links to a svg files:

[![extensions svg inside symbolic links that I want to change to png][3]][3]

If there is a way possible to change extension svg to png inside all symbolix links the icon theme would be working fine in Fluxbox menu and File Managers. [I made a entrie about this icon theme using in Xubuntu but in spanish][4] 

God Bless
