Because PeaZip for Linux comes default with the scripts, all you need to do is move them into the correct location.

To get started, press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open terminal. When it opens, follow the steps below:

1. For installed version, the PeaZip should be installed under /usr/local/share/PeaZip. Run command to move the scripts:

cd /usr/local/share/PeaZip/FreeDesktop_integration/nautilus-scripts/Archiving/PeaZip/

sudo mv * ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts
2. For portable version, just go to the PeaZip directory “FreeDesktop_integration/nautilus-scripts/Archiving/PeaZip/”, copy and paste all scripts to “user HOME/.local/share/nautilus/scripts”.
