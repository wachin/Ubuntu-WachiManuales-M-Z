
in UbuntuStudio 15.10 when open	nautilus lost my desktop icons and files




"--no-desktop
    Do not manage the desktop -- ignore the preference set in the
    preferences dialog." - http://linux.die.net/man/1/nautilus

So likely you can disable it by it's preferences, but at least by
launching nautilus with the --no-desktop option.

You could edit the desktop file in /usr/share/applications/.
For Caja and Nemo it's the same, while for other file managers it
usually is vice versa, e.g.

[rocketmouse@archlinux ~]$ spacefm --help | grep desk
  --desktop                    Launch desktop manager daemon
  --desktop-pref               Show desktop settings
  --set-wallpaper              Set desktop wallpaper to FILE
  --no-desktop                 No function - for compatibility only
