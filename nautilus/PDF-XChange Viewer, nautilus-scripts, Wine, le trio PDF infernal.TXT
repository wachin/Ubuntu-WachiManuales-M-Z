Note: The submenu 'Scripts' only appears once you have at least one script in the scripts directory.

For a script to be found by Nautilus it needs to be located in your scripts directory (~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/, before Ubuntu 14.04 that was '~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts'). This folder is located in your home folder but is hidden by default. To view hidden files and folders in Nautilus press Ctrl+H, or use the terminal to navigate to the folder:

cd ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/

env WINEPREFIX="/home/<REMPLACER_PAR_VOTRE_USER>/.wine" wine "C:\PDFV_Portable\PDFXCview.exe" "$@"
exit 0


O sea que mi scritp debe quedar as√≠:

env WINEPREFIX="/home/wachin/.wine" wine "C:\Program Files\MediaInfo\mediainfo.exe" "$@"
