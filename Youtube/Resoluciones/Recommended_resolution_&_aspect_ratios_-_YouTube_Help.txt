Recommended resolution & aspect ratios

YouTube uses 16:9 aspect ratio players. The YouTube player automatically adds black bars to videos in the player so that videos are displayed correctly without cropping or stretching, regardless of the size of the video or the player.

Recommended resolution & aspect ratios
To fit the player perfectly, encode at these resolutions:

2160p: 3840x2160
1440p: 2560x1440
1080p: 1920x1080
720p: 1280x720
480p: 854x480
360p: 640x360
240p: 426x240
You can adjust the fit of your video in the YouTube player after uploading your video using formatting tags.
