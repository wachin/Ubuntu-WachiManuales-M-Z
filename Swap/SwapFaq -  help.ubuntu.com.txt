Activating the swap partition

(If your swap is on your primary hard drive, you don't need to do anything here.) Now you need to find what partition your swap is on and what its UUID is. UUID?! you say? Well that's the Universally Unique IDentifier for the partition so you can reference it even if it's on a different mount point from boot-to-boot due to adding disks, etc.

    Pull up a terminal and run gksu gparted & and enter your root password. The & lets this process run while still giving you access to the command line.
    Right-click on your swap partition and choose *Information*. You should see the **Path** and **UUID** listed there. Keep this open for further reference.

    Run gksu gedit /etc/fstab & and look for the line that has *swap* in it. It should be the third column, separated by spaces or tabs. You can either use the path or the UUID to tell Linux where to find your swap partition. I recommend UUID because it'll stay constant even if you move the partition around or the disk somehow becomes sdb instead of sda or something like that. Make the appropriate edits and save the file. Your line should look something like this if you used UUID (with your UUID instead, of course):

        UUID=41e86209-3802-424b-9a9d-d7683142dab7 none swap sw 0 0

        or this if you used path: /dev/sda2 none swap sw 0 0 
    Save the file.

    Enable the new swap partition with this command.

    sudo swapon --all
