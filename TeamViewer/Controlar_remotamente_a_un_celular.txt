you can use teamviewer, download it for your computer here

https://www.teamviewer.com/download/linux/

and download teamviewer host for your phone here

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamviewer.host.market

you will get a secure connection between them

and are able to control the screen and phone fully
