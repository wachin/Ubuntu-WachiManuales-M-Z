About CamDesk:
CamDesk is a free, open source, desktop webcam widget, that was created as home surveillance application, and for demonstration purposes to use with CamStudio (http://camstudio.org/) for screen casting.

Requirements:
    Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8 - 32bit
    1.05MB of hard disk space
    Webcam
    Webcam Drivers
    .NET Framework 4.0 - http://www.microsoft.com/net/

How To Use CamDesk:
    Click and drag to move CamDesk
    Double click for fullscreen (F11)
    Click and hold left mouse button down on CamDesk for 2.5 seconds and the preferences window pops up. (NOTE: If you hold to long it'll hide, and show, as it's on a timer.) (CTRL+P)
    Right click for menu functionality for CamDesk
    In order to close CamDesk click the top right "X" image in the preferences window, or close via right click on CamDesk (ALT+F4)
    Start/Stop webcam (F1)
    Record (take photos: default interval is set at 3000ms, or 3s, and you can change this in the preferences window) (F2)
    Snapshot/Take a Picture (F3)

TIP: If you don't want the drop shadow to display, right click "Computer" and select "Properties". Now click on "Advanced system settings". System Properties should pop up, and you should be on the Advanced tab by default. Click on "Settings" in the "Performance" group under the Advanced Tab. Now uncheck "Show shadows under windows". This will disable the drop shadow on all your windows. Currently there's no way to disable it only for CamDesk, but that is planned to be implemented in a later release.

NOTE: There's no built in option to change webcam source! You must restart CamDesk to do so.
