You can read the history.log file in /var/log/apt.

Eg. less /var/log/apt/history.log



As an alternative to lgarzo's answer, you can grep what you are interested in from /var/log/dpkg.log. E.g., if you want to see everything you installed or upgraded yesterday, you could run:

cat /var/log/dpkg.log | grep "^2012-03-25.*\ installed\ "
One thing to note: this will also list manually installed packages (sudo dpkg -i ...), which won't show up in apt's history.

Even better use zgrep if it's installed so you can find lines in gzipped files as well

zgrep "^2012-03-25.*\ installed\ " /var/log/dpkg.log*
