How to batch convert xcf to png
https://linkpeek.com/blog/how-to-batch-convert-xcf-to-png.html

This is how I installed xcf2png:

sudo apt-get install xcftools

This is the one-line bash program I wrote to batch convert xcf to png:

for file in *.xcf; do xcf2png "$file" > "$file.png" ; done

Tada! like magic I now had both the original xcf and a new png of each image!
