Another option is to add set -x to the script where you would like execution to begin debugging. You can also use set +x to stop.

Example:

#!/bin/sh
set -x
echo "This will be debugged"
set +x
echo "This will not be debugged"

process - How can I see the exact command line being executed inside some bash instance? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange

I know you found your own answer, but is there a reason you can't do something like this:

(set -x; for f in 1 2 3 4 ; do  echo "$f"; sleep $f; done)

Perhaps you can't co-mingle the output of the actual job and the output from bash showing the currently executing line.

Also, FWIW, if you prefer verbosity, set -o xtrace.
