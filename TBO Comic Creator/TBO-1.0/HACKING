Collaborating
-------------

If you like that project and you want to collaborate there is some
parts where you can do something that you know.

    * Create a 'doodle library'.
    * 'translate' to your mother language.
    * 'package' for your favourite distribution.
    * If you are a coder take a look to the TODO file.

Doodle library
--------------

A doodle library is a set of .svg files with doodles, shapes, or
something that you want to can add in a TBO frame easy. Is easy to
create your own doodle library, it's only a folder with one or more
folder inside, and each folder with one or more .svg files.

Look for an example the 'foo' or 'bubble' libraries in data/doodle.

Translations
------------

To generate translations file .po exec:

$ cd po
$ intltool-update es

'es' is the language code. Then you need to translate the .po file.
