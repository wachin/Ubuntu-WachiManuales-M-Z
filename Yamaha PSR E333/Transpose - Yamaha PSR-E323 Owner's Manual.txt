Octave; Transpose - Yamaha PSR-E323 Owner's Manual [Page 49]
http://www.manualslib.com/manual/340283/Yamaha-Psr-E323.html?page=49

The instrument's Transpose function makes it
possible to shift the pitch of the entire keyboard
up or down in semitone intervals to facilitate
playing in difﬁcult key signatures, and to let you
easily match the pitch of the keyboard to the
range of a singer or other instruments. For exam-
ple, if you set the transposition amount to "5,"
playing key C produces pitch F. In this way, you
can play a song as though it were in C major, and
the instrument will transpose it to the key of F.
