Ubuntu Linux (and variants)
If you are using Ubuntu Linux, or one of its variants (Kubuntu, Edubuntu, etc...) it is a fairly quick and easy process to get all the codecs you need to make things work. You will need to install two meta-packages that contain all the multimedia codecs that you will generally need. From the Software Center install ubuntu-restricted-extras and Kubuntu-restricted-extras, or from the terminal:

user@linux:~ $ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras kubuntu-restricted-extras
Note if you are running Kubuntu there is no need to install the ubuntu-restricted-extras meta-package
