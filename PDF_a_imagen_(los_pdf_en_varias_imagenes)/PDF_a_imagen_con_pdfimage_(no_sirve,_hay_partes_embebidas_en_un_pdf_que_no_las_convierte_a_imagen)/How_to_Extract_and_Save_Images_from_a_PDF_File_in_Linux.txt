The default image format is PPM (portable pixmap) for non-monochrome images, or PBM (portable bitmap) for monochrome images. These formats are designed to be easily exchanged between platforms.

NOTE: You may get two image files for each image in your PDF file. The second image for each image is blank, so, you’ll be able to tell which images contain the images from the file by the thumbnail on the file in the File Manager.

02_ppm_images

To create .jpg image files, add the “-j” option to the command, as shown below.


pdfimages -j /home/tu-usuario/Documents/SampleWithImages.pdf /home/tu-usuario/Documents/ExtractedImages/image



NOTE: You can also change the default output to PNG using the “-png” option or TIFF using the “-tiff” option.











03_command_for_jpg_files

The main image file for each image is saved as a .jpg file. The second blank image is still a .ppm or .pbm file.




04_jpg_images

If you only want to convert images on and after a certain page, use the “-f” option with a number to indicate the first page to convert, as shown in the example command below.

pdfimages -f 2 -j /home/lori/Documents/SampleWithImages.pdf /home/lori/Documents/ExtractedImages/image

NOTE: We combined the “-j” option with the “-f” option so we would get .jpg images and did the same with the “-l” option mentioned below as well.

05_first_page_to_convert

To convert all images before and on a certain page, use the “-l” (a lowercase “L”, not the number “1”) option with a number to indicate the last page to convert, as shown below.

pdfimages -l 1 -j /home/lori/Documents/SampleWithImages.pdf /home/lori/Documents/ExtractedImages/image

NOTE: You can use the “-f” and “-l” options together to convert images in a specific page range in the middle of your document.

06_last_page_to_convert

If there is an owner password on the PDF file, use the “-opw” option and the password in single quotes, as shown below. If the password on the PDF file is a user password, use the “-upw” option instead with the password.

NOTE: Make sure there are single quotes around your password in the command.

pdfimages -opw ‘password’ -j /home/lori/Documents/SampleWithImages.pdf /home/lori/Documents/ExtractedImages/image

For more information about using the pdfimages command, type “pdfimages” at the prompt in a Terminal window and press “Enter”. The command usage displays with a list of options available for use in the command.
