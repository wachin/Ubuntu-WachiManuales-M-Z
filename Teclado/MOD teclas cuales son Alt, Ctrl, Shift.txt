Se puede saber poniendo en la terminal:

wachin@mxlinux:~$ xmodmap
xmodmap:  up to 4 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)

Xmodmap mod keys

I always get confused with Xmodmap and the man page is not much use (which is why I prefer to rewrite the driver files), but I think

Lock = caps lock
Mod1 = alt (aka meta)
Mod2 = number lock
Mod4 = super (aka windows)
Mod5 = level 3 shift (aka AltGr, Opt)

Mod3 I can't remember 

The double naming can be confusing at first. "Caps_Lock" is the name of the key, as established by the keyboard driver, while "Lock" is the function it carries out.

If you have a pc keyboard without AltGr, you must be in the USA: everywhere else, it's where you have your right Alt key. The desktop configuration system will enable that to be changed, and the Level 3 Shift can go on RAlt, LAlt, RWin, LWin, Menu, LWin+RWin, etc, etc. I have it where the CapsLock used to be
