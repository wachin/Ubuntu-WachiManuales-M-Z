I'm using xubuntu 17.10 and I'm experimenting with compiz. I use the Greybird theme but out of the box compiz window decorations do not follow the xfce theme. I had unwanted opacity in the title bar, ugly and non-themed window buttons, and a title bar which was too big.

After compiz is active, try this: (thanks to arch linux documentation https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compiz/Configuration#Workspaces_and_Viewports)

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme Greybird
