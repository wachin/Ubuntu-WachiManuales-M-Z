Typography

Adapta strongly depends on Material Design resources, especially its fonts.

Noto Sans
Noto (NO TOfu) sans-serif truetype/opentype font covers a lot of languages.
Developed by Monotype and Adobe.
Weight used in Adapta: 400, (500), 700

Roboto
Very famous as the default truetype font in Android (English ver.).
Multilingual support is not good.
Weight used in Adapta: 300, 400, 500, 700

Note:
Roboto is very nice with Adapta, but in some locales, it causes Tofu.
NotoSans may work well in vairous locales, but NotoSans lacks 500 (Medium) weight. So elements defined with 500 will be drawn with 400 automatically.
NotoSans CJK supports 500 weight.

Adapta uses NotoSans as the primary font-family in Gnome-Shell and Cinnamon (Cantarell is for fallback). In some distributions, users may need to install fonts-noto-hinted.

Note:
In Gnome-Shell 3.26 theming, we've switched to Roboto already.
Adapta is designed with nominal 13px (or 14px) Roboto font. In Gnome, "window-scaling-factor = 1.0" means -gtk-dpi = 96, it also means:

13 [px] x 72 [pt/inch] / 96 [px/inch] = 9.75 [pt]
14 [px] x 72 [pt/inch] / 96 [px/inch] = 10.5 [pt]

That's the reason why 13.33px = 10pt is used for rem/px conversion in Gtk+ 3.2x theming (In Gtk+ 3.18.x theming, em unit is directly used).

Note:
NotoSans CJK (ChineseJapaneseKorean) opentype fonts are actually 0.1em taller than Roboto fonts, so if 10pt Roboto was suitable on your LCDs, set 9pt for NotoSans CJK families.
Verify the fonts are rendered correctly via font-viewer tools like Gnome-Font-Viewer.
