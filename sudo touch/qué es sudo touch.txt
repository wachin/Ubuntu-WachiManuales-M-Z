touch is a standard Unix command-line interface program which is used to update the access date and / or modification date of a file or directory. In its default usage, it is the equivalent of creating or opening a file and saving it without any change to the file contents. Touch eliminates the unnecessary steps of opening the file, saving the file, and closing the file again. Instead it simply updates the dates associated with the file or directory. An updated access or modification date can be important for a variety of other programs such as backup utilities or the make command-line interface programming utility. Typically these types of programs are only concerned with files which have been created or modified after the program was last run. Touch can also be useful for quickly creating files for programs or scripts that require a file with a specific name to exist for successful operation of the program, but do not require the file to have any specific content.
