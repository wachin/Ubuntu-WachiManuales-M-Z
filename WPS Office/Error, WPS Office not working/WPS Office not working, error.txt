WPS Office not working, error ${gInstallPath}/office6/${gApp} ${gOptExt} ${gOpt} "$@"


The solution is install Qt 4 Settings and change the theme

sudo apt-get install qt4-qtconfig

In Ubuntu 16.04 the launcher of this packages is called:

qtconfig-qt4

this you need to put in a terminal and launch (You can also look for it in the application launcher for your operating system but I can not do a tutorial for all of them since there is: Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, Ubuntu Gnome, Kubuntu, e.g.)

open this config dialog and chose GTK+



Error:
${gInstallPath}/office6/${gApp} ${gOptExt} ${gOpt} "$@"
