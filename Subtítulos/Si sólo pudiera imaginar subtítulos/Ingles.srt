1
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,411
<i>Thank you.</i>

2
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,584
<i>I found a song
that saved me through a time.</i>

3
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,753
<i>You know how music does that?</i>

4
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>I was dealing with loss,
with pain,</i>

5
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,010
<i>and I heard this song,</i>

6
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,471
<i>and it blew my soul
wide open.</i>

7
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:40,601
<i>It became my anthem.
It rescued me.</i>

8
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:45,606
<i>And I just kept wondering,
who could write this?</i>

9
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,358
<i>What did they have
to go through</i>

10
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,153
<i>to be able to give
this gift to me?</i>

11
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:55,699
<i>This is hope, pure hope.</i>

12
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,868
It's an amazing song.

13
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,205
Just kind of happened.

14
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,793
Lyrics took about ten minutes,
I guess.

15
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,670
Music took about the same.

16
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:14,092
Bart... you didn't write
this song in ten minutes.

17
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,219
It took a lifetime.

18
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,392
How'd you do this?

19
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,722
Bart? Bart?!

20
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,308
Well, mercy me,
you been out here all day!

21
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,689
How'd I do?

22
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,901
Oh, you done good, Bart.
You done real good.

23
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,489
I'll see you tomorrow!
Bye!

24
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,176
<i>A' You got me runnin',
goin' out of my mind A“</i>

25
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,377
'Cause, for me, you know,
without the song--

26
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,671
it's-- it's all about the song.

27
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,173
- Yeah.
- Doesn't matter what band, you know.

28
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,758
You might be interested
in this band.

29
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,802
It was one of the greatest
concerts I've ever seen.

30
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,844
It was amazing.

31
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,930
<i>A' Down, down, down 4'</i>

32
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:10,279
Hey,hon.

33
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,031
What you got there?

34
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:14,825
It's a fighter helmet
that I made

35
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,535
during a big battle in space.

36
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,120
You sure worked hard on that,
didn't you?

37
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,623
' ' Yeah.

38
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,767
- What's this?
- It's just-- it's just junk.

39
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,729
<i>Mother: You're a dreamer, Bart.
That's good.</i>

40
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,064
Haven't you ever
imagined anything?

41
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,233
I'm gonna teach you
something, Bart.

42
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:47,364
Dreams don't pay the bills.
Nothing good comes from it.

43
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:52,453
All it does...

44
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,955
is keep you from all this.

45
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,543
From knowing what's real.

46
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,065
<i>You understand that?</i>

47
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:09,029
- Huh?!
- Yes, Daddy.

48
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:12,950
Well, you say that's
a piece of junk,

49
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,077
why don't you just go
throw it away?

50
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,374
Go, just go.
He'll take it.

51
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,750
It's okay, it's okay.

52
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:46,131
<i>Father:
Stay out of it!</i>

53
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,842
<i>It's none of your business!
It's between him and me.</i>

54
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:52,178
<i>Someone's gotta make sure
that he is raised up right!</i>

55
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:55,682
<i>Shut your mouth!
Or I'll shut it for you!</i>

56
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:02,856
<i>You want some more?
You want some more?</i>

57
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,859
<i>Here, had enough yet?
Had enough yet?</i>

58
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,744
Hey. Bart? Shh.

59
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,372
It's okay. Hey.

60
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:38,582
- Mom?
- Ready for an adventure?

61
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,459
- Now?
- Yes, right now.

62
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:43,254
<i>Mother:
It's called Camp Glorieta.</i>

63
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,297
<i>Church down the street
takes kids there.</i>

64
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:46,799
<i>It's a fun camp.</i>

65
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:48,759
<i>I called,
and they said you could go.</i>

66
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:52,846
Come on,
you're gonna have a great time.

67
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,726
You're gonna make some friends.
You'll make some memories.

68
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:03,274
Can we just do this?

69
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:08,153
Do what?

70
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:10,489
Just drive.

71
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:11,865
Drive and listen.

72
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:17,871
Listen to this music.
Me and you.

73
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:21,917
Just listen to the words.

74
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,786
Okay. This is it.

75
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:03,751
You ain't never met
a stranger? Hmm?

76
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,587
- All right, I can do this.
- Yeah.

77
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,714
- Geronimo.
- Hey.

78
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,217
You know I love you, right?

79
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:15,220
Okay.

80
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,475
Go on. Get outta here.

81
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:21,810
Bye, Mom.

82
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:33,030
Oh, gosh. I can do this.
I can do this.

83
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:36,492
No Walkmans at camp.
They'll take it up.

84
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:37,951
Are you kidding?

85
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:44,667
Oh, um, hi.
Uh, I'm-- I'm Bart.

86
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,045
My friends, like,
they call me Bart.

87
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:52,132
I know. I'm Shannon. Duh!

88
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,718
- Ready for camp?
- Mmm.

89
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:56,637
It's totally safe!

90
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,056
See? Safe.

91
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,767
Well,
except for that one kid.

92
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,103
You coming?

93
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,660
Sorry, sorry.
Squeeze in here. Sorry.

94
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:21,537
Oh, sorry 'bout that!

95
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,415
- Hey, Bart, this is Kent.
- Nice to meet you, Bart.

96
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:27,459
Hey, bro. This is the cup game.
I'm not very good at it.

97
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,920
<i>Campers.
Campers, up here!</i>

98
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,255
<i>So I'm Rusty.</i>

99
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,048
For those of you
who don't know me,

100
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:35,342
I'm the Youth Pastor
at Greenville Baptist.

101
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:36,593
So if you didn't bring
yourjournals, come up here.

102
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:38,387
<i>We got one for you.</i>

103
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,639
You're gonna need it
for your session tonight.

104
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,183
- Let's have a great week.
- Bro, sit down. I got you.

105
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,523
So is that like a diary, or?

106
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:52,860
Kinda, but there's more to it.
Helps get my thoughts ordered.

107
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:56,196
Prayers, problems, dreams,
stuff I imagine sometimes.

108
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,656
Uh, can I see?

109
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,409
I'm sorry,
I-- I didn't know.

110
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:03,662
B-9, you're with me for
kitchen duty, let's do it.

111
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,956
Well, that's me.
See you later, okay?

112
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,708
Hey, Bart,
I got yourjournal.

113
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,168
Ooh! Kent!

114
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,137
Here you go.
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:33,484
That's mint.
I didn't know you could draw.

116
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,903
Why're you dressed
like that?

117
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:38,781
Come with me
if you want to live!

118
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:41,241
We're sneaking out.

119
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:45,537
So what do you wanna be
when you grow up, an artist?

120
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:49,833
Eh, or a football player.
That's what my dad was.

121
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:53,462
He was really good, actually.
Kind of famous in college.

122
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:56,632
We're gonna get
in so much trouble for this.

123
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,383
I know, right?
Got some great stuff.

124
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:01,261
Like industrial grade.
Set it all up this afternoon.

125
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,764
So you guys are gonna go
over there

126
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:05,599
and face in the north direction,
got it?

127
00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:11,438
And also,
did you know Bart can draw?

128
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:14,483
Hi.

129
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:21,198
- So you can draw?
- I guess so, a little bit.

130
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:24,785
Bart, I'm terrified you saw
what was written in my journal.

131
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:26,578
- Did you?
- No.

132
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,914
- Wh-what're you talking about?
- You're lying.

133
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:30,874
You saw every word,
didn't you?

134
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,169
Maybe.

135
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:37,464
Well, then here goes.
You know what I think?

136
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:39,341
I think that someday
we're gonna fall in love,

137
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:42,135
get married,
and that's our destiny.

138
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:44,805
And now I'm mortified.

139
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:46,098
I'm gonna walk down this hill
and help Kent.

140
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,433
Wa-wa-wa-wait wait.
Shannon, please stay.

141
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:53,188
Why? Afraid of the dark?
Afraid of monsters?

142
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:55,983
L just don't like
being alone.

143
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,476
All right, come on, kids.

144
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,020
Shannon: Bart, Bart!

145
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,649
- Here. It's my favorite.
- Sweet.

146
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,860
And I wanna be a singer
just like her someday.

147
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:41,820
Thank you so much.

148
00:14:41,904 --> 00:14:45,324
My parents are here pick me up.
Bye!

149
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:05,928
<i>Man:
Last stop. This is you.</i>

150
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,973
<i>It was good to meet you, Bart.
Am I gonna see you on Sunday?</i>

151
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:11,600
Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:25,739
Hey.

153
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:36,917
Momma? Momma...

154
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,168
<i>Where's Momma?</i>

155
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,296
She's gone.

156
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,173
Gone where?

157
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:46,468
She ran off.
She ain't coming back.

158
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:48,553
<i>Just you and me now.</i>

159
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,519
When will she be back?

160
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:57,521
I told you, she run off.

161
00:15:57,604 --> 00:16:01,733
She don't want me no more,
and she don't want you neither.

162
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:05,237
What did you do?

163
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,656
Are you bowing up on me, boy?

164
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:10,450
You hurt her, didn't you?!

165
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,161
- Hey!
- You hurt her like you hurt me!

166
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:14,204
Hey!

167
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,957
Nothing! That's what I did!

168
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,291
Nothing!

169
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,385
She didn't leave 'cause of me.

170
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:53,994
I'm sorry, Mom!

171
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:55,746
What did I do?!

172
00:16:57,998 --> 00:17:00,917
Take me, Mom, please!

173
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,586
stop!

174
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:19,186
<i>Woman: So did you ever
see her again?</i>

175
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,522
Uh, she'd call now and then.

176
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:25,150
I tried to live with her once,
one summer in junior high,

177
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:28,195
but she was in another bad
relationship.

178
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,030
Worse, actually.

179
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:34,826
Um, my dad drove up and threw
the guy off a staircase

180
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,037
onto the hood of his car
and threatened to kill him

181
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,872
if he ever hurt her again

182
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:42,042
and then grabbed me
and took me home.

183
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,419
It's kind of ironic.

184
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:48,381
Um, that was about it.

185
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:50,383
So what did you do?

186
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:56,139
I tried to get good at the only
thing my dad really cared about.

187
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:03,105
<i>- Hey, there.
- Hey there, damn'.</i>

188
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:04,856
That's so corny.

189
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,817
You're making
everyone in the stadium

190
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,443
feel real uncomfortable.

191
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,196
Dude, seriously,
that beard makes you look 35.

192
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,615
- Kent, shut up.
- Shut up!

193
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:14,908
I like it.

194
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:19,246
Millard!
Get over here, now.

195
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:21,748
I love you.

196
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,085
I know.

197
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,296
Unbelievable.

198
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,465
- Break!
- Break!

199
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:03,498
Hey. Just give me a second.

200
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:09,129
- It's sour.
- Jeez.

201
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:11,423
It's a month past its date.

202
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:15,635
I'll make Pop-Tarts, then.

203
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,806
Just a few things I ask you
to do around here, Bart,

204
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,141
a few things.

205
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,147
I caught before I ran, Dad,
at practice today.

206
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,232
Almost scored.

207
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,902
- How many of them did it take?
- What?

208
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,321
To get you down on the ground.
How many'd it take?

209
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:38,408
- Just one. It's just practice.
- One?

210
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:40,744
<i>Nobody could never
bring me down.</i>

211
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:45,332
Took the whole football team.
It's the way I live my life.

212
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:48,001
<i>Life hits me,
I hit back harder.</i>

213
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,297
I don't go down.
Not then, not now, not never.

214
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:55,717
You understand?

215
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:01,890
All: Break!

216
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:05,936
<i>Father: I don't go down.</i>

217
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,188
<i>You go down too easy.
That's your problem.</i>

218
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:01,324
What'd they say?

219
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:03,743
They said you can't play.

220
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:05,537
For how long?

221
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,038
Even

222
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,255
Well, that's disappointing.

223
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:17,716
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

224
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:28,727
- Whoa! Hey.
- Sorry.

225
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,354
- Where are you driving?
- I should've drove.

226
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:32,856
This is stupid.

227
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:34,941
Graduating high school
is not stupid.

228
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:37,569
You just have to pick a new
elective to replace football.

229
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,195
- Yeah.
- Okay.

230
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,991
Oh, man, ever have aspirations
of being a seamstress?

231
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:46,745
Well, that's full, so.
They're, like, all full.

232
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:49,664
- Yeah.
- Except this one.

233
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:53,043
- What?
- Glee Club.

234
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:59,090
<i>Group:
4' And even though it all went wrong 4'</i>

235
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,027
<i>- L' Hallelujah I'
- A' Hallelujah a'</i>

236
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:35,835
That's really good.

237
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,921
Honey, I think
you've got the wrong room.

238
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:41,174
I wish. No offense.

239
00:22:41,257 --> 00:22:43,343
None taken. You sing?

240
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:44,719
No.

241
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:47,055
- Act?
- Not at all.

242
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:50,058
- Do you dance?
- Ma'am, I'm in a wheelchair.

243
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:51,851
Please, just kick me
out of this class.

244
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,940
I don't turn anyone away.
Sugar, what is your name?

245
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:59,109
Uh, Bart Millard.

246
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:03,029
- "Bart Millard."
- Yeah.

247
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:06,825
Our new assistant
technical director.

248
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:08,576
All right!

249
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,245
I don't know what that is.

250
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,590
Now this I can do.

251
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:51,411
<i>Bart: A“ Let's go X</i>

252
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,029
Hey, congrats, Bart.

253
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:29,782
- What?
- Way to go, Millard.

254
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,747
- Congratulations!
- What?

255
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,874
- Woman: Nice job, Bart.
- You haven't heard yet?

256
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:39,876
I gotta say,
I'm a little jealous.

257
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:42,712
What're you t--
what're you talking about?

258
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,881
- Congratulations!
- No, no, no, no. Okay.

259
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:54,224
How excited are you?

260
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,103
Miss Fincher!

261
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:05,068
Unh-unh. No.
What're you trying to do to me?

262
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,862
I can't do this.
I didn't even try out.

263
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:09,906
You can. And you will.

264
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,908
And there'll be no further
discussion about it.

265
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:14,285
No, no, no, no, no.
Look, I'm a Millard.

266
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:16,746
Okay, you don't understand.
Millards play football.

267
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,832
- Millards do not sing.
- You have a gift, Bart.

268
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,627
And in my class,
you will be required to use it.

269
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,546
Or fail. It's your choice.

270
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:26,464
Look, my leg is still in a cast.
I can't even walk.

271
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:28,591
There's two months
until the production.

272
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:31,261
You have plenty of time to heal.
Please stop making excuses.

273
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:34,097
Okay, I don't sing like that.
That Broadway stuff.

274
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,306
I'll teach you.

275
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,600
Look, Miss Fincher,
I like you, okay?

276
00:25:37,684 --> 00:25:39,602
You seem like
a real good person.

277
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:43,606
I respect you,
but there is no way, ever,

278
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:49,028
at all, ever that you are
gonna get me on that stage.

279
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,072
Mm-hmm.

280
00:26:32,405 --> 00:26:35,450
Mercy me,
that can't be his real voice.

281
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:36,951
Yeah, it is, Mama.

282
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:45,043
Well,
punch a monkey's uncle.

283
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:52,735
Whoo!

284
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,214
Sir, you need to understand.
It's hospital policy.

285
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:16,217
Well, you can't keep me here.
I'm free to go.

286
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,803
No, you're not.

287
00:28:18,886 --> 00:28:20,388
We saw something
in your blood work

288
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:22,932
that concerned us,
so we ran a few tests.

289
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,684
And I'd like to discuss
the results with you.

290
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:27,061
You got my number.
You can call me.

291
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:29,605
We need to have
this conversation now.

292
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,190
Okay.

293
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:36,237
Why did I black out?

294
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,198
Because of extremely
low blood sugar.

295
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:43,077
So you're saying, what?
I'm diabetic?

296
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:44,662
No.

297
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:47,540
On your MRI,
we discovered a mass.

298
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:49,917
- We believe it's cancer.
- No.

299
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:53,171
No. No, I don't--

300
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:55,173
We'd like to run
a few more tests

301
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,550
and then decide on the best
treatment options for you.

302
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:02,221
I don't--
I don't need your treatment.

303
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,682
I'm gonna go home.

304
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:09,645
Mr. Millard,
if you refuse treatment,

305
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:11,981
it could drastically reduce
your chances.

306
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:25,912
Dad. What happened?

307
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:29,207
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

308
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,750
Okay, well,
let me drive you home.

309
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,251
L-I can make it myself.

310
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:35,546
Mr. Millard, are you okay?

311
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,341
I'm Shannon,
Bart's girlfriend?

312
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:41,469
Oh, hello, Shannon.

313
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:44,680
How'd Bart wind up
with someone as pretty as you?

314
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:46,432
Thank you.

315
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:48,768
I'm fine.
I'm gonna be all right.

316
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:50,645
But did they say what's wrong?

317
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,063
Uh, I just had a little incident.

318
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:53,648
I had low blood sugar.

319
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:57,276
I was over at the diner,
and-- and I fell down.

320
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,822
And actually,
I was looking at your name

321
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:03,991
on an advertisement
for a play.

322
00:30:05,451 --> 00:30:07,787
Didn't think you'd wanna come.

323
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:13,459
Did he ever sing for you?
'Cause I-l had no idea.

324
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:15,086
I had no idea at all.

325
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,587
He was good.
He was real good.

326
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:18,589
I'm sorry, Dad.
I should've invited you.

327
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:21,342
Oh, don't-- we'll talk
about it later, son.

328
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,969
- Just let me drive you home.
- Oh, no.

329
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:26,430
You take care
of your pretty girl there.

330
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:30,768
Where're you going?

331
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:34,021
Going to the cast party.
I'm not missing it for this.

332
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:40,069
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
What's wrong with him?

333
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,238
- Are you family?
- No.

334
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,448
Well, you need to ask him.

335
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:45,867
Thank you.

336
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,969
You're up early.

337
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:07,513
Made my son breakfast.

338
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:10,349
What's with the getup?
Going to a funeral?

339
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:13,477
No.
Just going to church, Dad.

340
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:15,187
Church.

341
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,942
Sit down and eat.

342
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:26,198
C'mon, sit down and eat.
Getting cold.

343
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:30,536
Hey'd you see this?
Did you see that?

344
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,082
Look at that.
Front page.

345
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,293
You look like
a Pinocchio cowboy.

346
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:40,963
It's a good joke.

347
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:43,841
So that's what I am to you,
a joke?

348
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:46,510
- I didn't say that.
- You just said it.

349
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,095
Don't put words in my mouth.

350
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,140
What if I wanna sing?
Why's that so funny?

351
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:53,184
I mean, maybe I'm good at it.

352
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:56,020
The pastor of the church
asked me to sing this morning.

353
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:57,647
It's gotta mean something.

354
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,815
He ask you to sing
for a living?

355
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:01,442
That's what I'm saying.

356
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:03,486
You're gonna need to find
something you're good at

357
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:05,237
that you can actually earn
a living at

358
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:07,156
'cause you're gonna have
to support yourself

359
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,574
- one of these days.
- How do you even know?

360
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:10,910
You've never even heard me sing.

361
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:12,578
Well, that's not my fault.

362
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:15,623
All I hear out of you
is whining and moaning.

363
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:19,585
Okay. I'm singing
this morning at church.

364
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,504
10:00 on radio AM 1080.

365
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:23,589
- Why don't you come watch me sing?
- No, I can't do that.

366
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,591
- Why not?
- No. I just don't belong there.

367
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:28,177
- Why?
- I just don't. I don't!

368
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:31,681
Don't belong there.

369
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:33,307
Okay.

370
00:32:39,438 --> 00:32:41,190
My boy Bart's, oh,

371
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:42,942
he's nothin'
but a big disappointment.

372
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:45,778
I wish he'd never been born.
Everything'd been just fine.

373
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:48,072
- Hey"
- All my problems are because of Bart.

374
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:49,490
Hey, hey,
you put words in my mouth.

375
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:51,534
I'm gonna put a fist
in your face.

376
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:52,702
Yeah, I'm a little big
for that, Dad.

377
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,412
- You think?
- I think those days are over.

378
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:56,372
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah! I do, yeah!

379
00:32:56,455 --> 00:32:58,207
Listen, you have
to talk to me with respect.

380
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,084
I'm the one that puts
the food on the table.

381
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,420
I earn the living around here,
and I'm the one who stayed.

382
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,171
I don't see your Momma
anywhere.

383
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:05,923
Yeah, well, nobody blames
her for leaving, Dad!

384
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,008
I would've left, too!

385
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:12,304
Just shut up.
Just shut up and eat.

386
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:14,015
- I'm not hungry.
- Eat your food.

387
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:15,766
I'm not hung"!!!

388
00:33:19,478 --> 00:33:21,105
All right, then.

389
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:32,074
You kidding me?!
Stay away from me!

390
00:33:32,158 --> 00:33:34,410
I'm serious!
Don't touch me!

391
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:38,539
I'm done with you! You're crazy!
Get away from me!

392
00:34:17,536 --> 00:34:18,704
Bart, what happened
to your head?

393
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:20,331
It's bleeding.

394
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:22,124
- Oh, it's nothing, it's fine.
- Are you okay?

395
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,709
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine

396
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:27,379
<i>Shannon: I'm wondering
if you guys could all</i>

397
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:29,381
<i>maybe pray
for a friend of mine?</i>

398
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:33,469
This friend I think is lying
to me about their life.

399
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:35,596
I don't know what to do
because I wanna help,

400
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,640
and they just won't let me,
and I just feel like

401
00:34:37,723 --> 00:34:41,393
the more I try,
it just kind of gets worse and worse.

402
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:45,272
And so now when I look at them,
all I see is a mask.

403
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,692
<i>Pray for them.</i>

404
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:52,321
No one can live a lie forever,
okay?

405
00:34:52,404 --> 00:34:53,906
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

406
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,741
Bart: <i>Course they know
you're talking about me.</i>

407
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:57,493
<i>Do you know how embarrassing
that is?</i>

408
00:34:57,576 --> 00:34:59,829
I was just trying
to get you to listen!

409
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:01,247
What is going on with you?!

410
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,083
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine!

411
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,835
Is it your dad?
I could help.

412
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:08,671
- Just let me come over.
- I don't want you at my house.

413
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:11,215
- Why?
- 'Cause I just don't.

414
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:12,842
Where is this coming from?

415
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:14,844
I don't know, maybe from deep
inside my mask.

416
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,720
- That's not funny.
- It's kinda funny.

417
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:18,514
- Please, don't do this.
- You got me all figured out.

418
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:20,933
You push everyone away!
Don't add me to that list.

419
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,643
I love you.
I've always loved you!

420
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:24,728
Yeah, well,
I've never really loved you.

421
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:29,400
I mean, we're--
we're graduating soon.

422
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:30,901
You're going off to college.
I'm chasing some stupid dream.

423
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:32,987
- Right?
- I never said your dream was stupid.

424
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,239
I mean, this has been fun.
No regrets for me, all right?

425
00:35:35,322 --> 00:35:36,740
But people change,
you know what I mean?

426
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,450
We obviously can't
get along anymore.

427
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:42,997
I'm leaving, Shannon.
After graduation I'm-- I'm gone.

428
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,796
Shannon: Please don't.

429
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,382
Bart: <i>What?</i>

430
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,467
Shannon: Go.

431
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:57,636
Bart: <i>I</i> can't stay here,
Shannon.

432
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:29,293
Man: You know, Mike, it's amazing how
people quit when they don't get paid.

433
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:30,961
- I should try that sometime.
- Man: All right, look, we are opening

434
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:33,881
for the opening act
at a youth conference.

435
00:36:33,964 --> 00:36:35,841
It's impossible,
that's the whole problem.

436
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:38,594
"Whether you think you can
or you think you can't,

437
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:40,638
you're right"--
that's Confucius.

438
00:36:40,721 --> 00:36:42,348
I don't even know
what that means.

439
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:43,933
And it's offensive to me
as an artist.

440
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:46,227
An artist?
We're making 90 bucks!

441
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,645
- Right.
- Between the three of us.

442
00:36:47,728 --> 00:36:49,855
We have no vocals.
We got no show.

443
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:51,607
It's impossible.

444
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,692
Bassist: Yeah, well,
the only impossible things

445
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,444
are the things
that we call impossible.

446
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:56,862
What is that? Aristotle?

447
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:59,531
No, that one's a fortune cookie.

448
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:01,951
Nathan,
nobody understands you, man!

449
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,744
- Hey, guys.
- You're always so cranky, man.

450
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:05,412
- Yeah, since Des Moines.
- Oh, Des Moines.

451
00:37:05,496 --> 00:37:07,039
Why bring up
Des Moines again?

452
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:09,625
Hey, guys, if you guys
need a singer, I'll sing.

453
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:12,962
I'm, uh--
I also patch cables,

454
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:14,755
and, you know,
I can run the board,

455
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:20,219
and turn the lights on,
and I write songs, too.

456
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:21,720
Kind of. Sometimes.

457
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:25,349
Who are you?

458
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,937
<i>Bart:
I joined up with the band.</i>

459
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,523
<i>All we had was the clothes
on our backs.</i>

460
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,525
<i>Took every gig we could,</i>

461
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:35,985
<i>anywhere they'd let us play.</i>

462
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:38,362
<i>We were all technically
homeless, I guess.</i>

463
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,101
<i>FOhhA'</i>

464
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:32,791
Whoo!

465
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,210
Give it up for Mike
on the guitar!

466
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:36,962
Yeah!

467
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:41,717
Mr. Nathan on the bass!
Give it up for Nathan!

468
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,471
Jim on the keys!

469
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:47,181
- Yeah!
- Yeah, and I'm Bart.

470
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:49,975
And we are Mercy--

471
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,228
And Robbie on the drums!

472
00:38:55,814 --> 00:38:57,316
He's new.

473
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,318
Thank you all
for being here tonight.

474
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:00,736
Y'all have a good time?

475
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,905
Yeah!

476
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:06,867
I sure hope so 'cause
that's all the songs we got.

477
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:12,331
Woman: Encore!

478
00:39:12,414 --> 00:39:13,791
You know what?

479
00:39:13,874 --> 00:39:15,501
Let me tell you a story
before we go.

480
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:20,005
Um... 'cause when I was, uh...

481
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:23,801
ten, 11 years old,
life was tough.

482
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:26,637
<i>I mean, it--
it was really tough, actually.</i>

483
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,640
I needed something,
and I remember, I've--

484
00:39:29,723 --> 00:39:32,935
I've always loved music,
you know?

485
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:37,022
<i>And I found some songs
that I just--</i>

486
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:41,151
<i>man, I-- I held onto,
you know what I mean?</i>

487
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:44,905
<i>Like an anchor in a storm.
And they got me through.</i>

488
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:49,159
And they told me about
a Father in heaven that--

489
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,786
that wanted me.

490
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:54,581
<i>You know,
a Father that loves me so much</i>

491
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:57,501
that He died for me.

492
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:59,128
A Father
that would never leave me.

493
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:01,964
<i>And I listened to these songs
over and over</i>

494
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:06,427
<i>and over and over again and--
and they gave me hope.</i>

495
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,388
'Cause I needed it.

496
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,015
And maybe tonight, so do you.

497
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:14,518
<i>Sing this with me.</i>

498
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,329
Thanks for coming, guys. Appreciate it.
Hey, Bart.

499
00:41:57,412 --> 00:42:00,249
- Hey, where you headed, man?
- Someone I gotta see, man.

500
00:42:00,332 --> 00:42:02,042
- Who?
- Scott Brickell.

501
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,211
He manages Audio Adrenaline
and a bunch of others.

502
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:06,838
- Yeah, well, why was he here?
- 'Cause I wrote him a letter

503
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,674
every week
for the past two years.

504
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:10,384
- Gotta go.
- Uh“

505
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:17,140
- Mr. Brickell!
- It's just Brickell.

506
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:19,184
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, okay.

507
00:42:19,268 --> 00:42:22,771
Um, I didn't know
you were coming. Thank you.

508
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:24,398
Yeah, well, I did.
Merry Christmas.

509
00:42:24,481 --> 00:42:28,235
Uh, you know, we mostly
just play, uh, big shows,

510
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:31,029
you know, but sometimes
we like to get back to,

511
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:33,115
you know,
smaller venues like this one.

512
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:35,951
- Yeah, look, Barth, uh--
- Uh, it's Bart.

513
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:38,912
Sorry. And what's the name
of your band again?

514
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:41,790
It's Mercy Me, you know,
'cause when I told my memaw

515
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,792
that we were starting a band,
she was, like,

516
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,627
"Mercy me, get a real job."

517
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,337
And I was, like,
"Aw, Memaw! "

518
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:49,548
And then the guys were like,
"Did she really say that?"

519
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:52,551
I was, like, "Yeah, we
have to name the band Mercy--"

520
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:55,387
So that's what we called it.

521
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,222
Son,
the sheer volume of words

522
00:42:57,306 --> 00:43:00,892
that comes outta your mouth
is... exhausting.

523
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:07,107
You're not ready.
That's what I think.

524
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,443
You got talent.
You got potential.

525
00:43:09,526 --> 00:43:13,822
You can sing, but I don't think
you've found your song,

526
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:15,657
Found your soul,
you know what I'm saying?

527
00:43:18,452 --> 00:43:22,664
Look, that last thing you did,
that was-- that was special.

528
00:43:22,748 --> 00:43:26,710
Next gig, you should do that
the whole time, the entire show.

529
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:28,253
See how that works for you.

530
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:30,422
That's not the kind of music
that we sing, though.

531
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:33,175
Trust me, son, you have no idea
what kind of music you sing.

532
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:35,218
We write our own music.
We don't just do covers.

533
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:37,387
Well, then write
something like that,

534
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:39,264
- and then give me a call.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

535
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:42,351
You gotta go with us.
We got two more shows in Texas.

536
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:45,062
We got plenty of room
on the bus, all right?

537
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:46,813
You know, you can't just
change up our whole act

538
00:43:46,897 --> 00:43:48,565
and then abandon us, right?

539
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:51,318
You don't seem like that
kind of person, I can tell.

540
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:55,364
I flew coach
in a middle seat

541
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:59,159
to rent a car
that I can't even fit in

542
00:43:59,242 --> 00:44:01,411
to drive three hours
to the middle of nowhere

543
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:06,625
to have you tell me you want me
to travel on that...

544
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,085
with you?

545
00:44:10,462 --> 00:44:11,505
Yeah.

546
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,846
That's funny.

547
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:23,141
I need to get another job.

548
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:35,529
Woman: Hello?

549
00:44:35,612 --> 00:44:36,947
Yes, is this Shannon Street?

550
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,824
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

551
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:41,410
Uh, it's the police, ma'am.
Uh, we need to speak with you.

552
00:44:41,493 --> 00:44:44,955
Can you come downstairs?
It's for your own safety.

553
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:52,295
Get the girl, Bart!
Woo-woo!

554
00:44:56,675 --> 00:44:58,969
- Shannon!
- Bart!

555
00:44:59,052 --> 00:45:03,098
Hey. Long time no see.
You look great.

556
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:04,766
It's midnight, Bart.
What are you doing here?

557
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,435
We lust played a gig here.

558
00:45:06,518 --> 00:45:08,228
I don't know
if you know this yet, but we--

559
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:10,939
we actually have a CD now
with actual songs on it.

560
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:14,276
Like a real CD.
Here, that's for you.

561
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,487
We have three more shows.
What if you came with us?

562
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:19,156
We could go on the road,
we could grab Kent.

563
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:20,866
Hit the road.
It'd be like before.

564
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:23,493
Three Musketeers.
I'm going to bed.

565
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,913
Aw, come on, Shannon.
Go on an adventure!

566
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:28,457
It'll be fun!

567
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,542
Adventure?

568
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:32,169
- Really?
- Yeah.

569
00:45:32,252 --> 00:45:34,880
What're you thinking,
coming here like this?

570
00:45:34,963 --> 00:45:36,506
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it.

571
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:38,175
L just thought
it'd be fun, you know?

572
00:45:38,258 --> 00:45:42,137
- Just an idea.
- That's it? Only reason?

573
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,514
Yep.

574
00:45:44,598 --> 00:45:47,893
I don't want to go on
any more adventures with you.

575
00:45:54,107 --> 00:45:55,358
You know,
I want you to know

576
00:45:55,442 --> 00:45:57,736
that I pray for you
all the time.

577
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,739
I do. I really do.

578
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:02,532
And I hope that you find

579
00:46:02,616 --> 00:46:05,994
whatever it is that
you're looking for out there.

580
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:07,996
Thank you for the CD.

581
00:46:11,374 --> 00:46:13,460
Forrest Gump's taking
his time back there.

582
00:46:15,378 --> 00:46:17,130
She will not be joining us.

583
00:46:17,214 --> 00:46:19,508
Shocker.

584
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:22,177
Well,
ain't she the smart one?

585
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,333
- It's good.
- Nathan, it's real good.

586
00:46:56,169 --> 00:46:59,422
Let's do it.
Let's blow him away.

587
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:01,109
Hey! Where you going?

588
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:02,444
Back to Nashville.

589
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:05,614
I've seen all I need to see.

590
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:09,534
Plus, I need to make some plans
on account

591
00:48:09,618 --> 00:48:11,786
of booking you guys
a venue for GMA week.

592
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,123
What is GMA week? What is that?

593
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:16,833
It's only the biggest
convention in music--

594
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:19,294
- Just go on the bus!
- All right.

595
00:48:19,377 --> 00:48:20,712
I couldn't get
the main stage,

596
00:48:20,795 --> 00:48:22,631
but I'll get
some record labels there.

597
00:48:22,714 --> 00:48:26,468
What I need you to do is invite
every youth group you can.

598
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:27,802
Stack the room.

599
00:48:27,886 --> 00:48:29,471
And then just do
what you did tonight.

600
00:48:29,554 --> 00:48:32,223
Wait.
So you liked tonight?

601
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:34,059
Don't get cocky, kid.

602
00:48:54,788 --> 00:48:56,581
<i>Hey, this is Shannon.
Leave a message.</i>

603
00:48:56,665 --> 00:48:59,960
<i> Bart: Hey, Shannon.</i>

604
00:49:00,043 --> 00:49:02,045
<i>Uh, it's Bart.</i>

605
00:49:02,128 --> 00:49:04,047
Just uh--

606
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,299
look, you said you, uh,
prayed for me

607
00:49:06,383 --> 00:49:08,760
all the time, and I, uh--

608
00:49:08,843 --> 00:49:11,972
<i>we're playing this, uh,
big showcase tomorrow,</i>

609
00:49:12,055 --> 00:49:15,016
<i>and, uh,
it's a big deal for us,</i>

610
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,435
<i>and we just, uh-- we're ready.</i>

611
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,482
But we're, uh, terrified too, um...

612
00:49:24,442 --> 00:49:28,571
<i>I guess that's it.
Just wanted to tell you that.</i>

613
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:29,572
<i>Uh...</i>

614
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:53,888
Little off-Broadway,
I know, but it's the best

615
00:49:53,972 --> 00:49:55,974
- I could do on short notice.
- Are you kidding me?

616
00:49:56,057 --> 00:49:57,684
This is perfect.

617
00:49:57,767 --> 00:49:59,686
Oh, and, guys,
this is your sound man, Dingo.

618
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:02,063
Anything you need,
you just let him know.

619
00:50:02,147 --> 00:50:04,107
You got us a sound guy?

620
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,984
Did you get a label to come?

621
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:08,111
No.

622
00:50:08,194 --> 00:50:11,281
I got five.
Working on a few more.

623
00:50:11,364 --> 00:50:14,534
L just need you to make sure
this place is full.

624
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,706
And bring the rain,
gentlemen.

625
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:21,666
- Yeah, you got it.
- Absolutely.

626
00:50:34,095 --> 00:50:37,140
Buddy, you ready for this?

627
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:38,391
<i>Brickell:
Good crowd, huh?</i>

628
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:43,021
Bart,
we've got a little situation

629
00:50:43,104 --> 00:50:45,190
I need to talk to you about.

630
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:48,610
<i>Come on.</i>

631
00:50:51,821 --> 00:50:53,948
So, Bart, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

632
00:50:54,032 --> 00:50:55,283
This is a friend of mine.

633
00:50:55,366 --> 00:50:56,826
He came down here tonight
to see us.

634
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:59,412
- Whoa, Smitty?!
- This is Michael W. Smith.

635
00:50:59,496 --> 00:51:02,624
Smitty, right?
That's what your friends call you, right?

636
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,751
Yeah, yeah, uh,
nice to meet you.

637
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:08,463
lam, like, a huge fan
from, like, all the--

638
00:51:08,546 --> 00:51:10,090
- sorry, like,
- That's okay, man.

639
00:51:10,173 --> 00:51:11,591
All the way back.
Way back.

640
00:51:11,674 --> 00:51:15,011
Your tour with Amy Grant
was just so inspiring for me.

641
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:18,264
I remember you wore
that vest, that red vest!

642
00:51:18,348 --> 00:51:20,058
- Dude, that was bold.
- I don't think I wore a red vest.

643
00:51:20,141 --> 00:51:21,476
- I would buy that vest.
- No, you did.

644
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:23,603
You wore this red vest.
You remember?

645
00:51:23,686 --> 00:51:26,314
Di-- did I wear a red vest
on our tour?

646
00:51:26,397 --> 00:51:27,482
- He did.
- Woman: Yes, you did.

647
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:29,943
<i>- It was velvet.</i>

648
00:51:30,026 --> 00:51:31,736
Oh, man.

649
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,238
What?

650
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:36,574
Miss Bart, I'm--
oh, we're-- okay.

651
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:41,746
Uh...

652
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:45,625
- You okay?
- I just threw up a little bit.

653
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:48,795
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I just-- you are like--

654
00:51:48,878 --> 00:51:52,507
The first Christian tape
lever got was "Never Alone."

655
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,511
And it was like...
like an anchor for me.

656
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:57,887
Thank you so much.
That means so much to me.

657
00:51:57,971 --> 00:52:00,849
Yeah, it was just--
It was-- it was great.

658
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:01,933
There you are.

659
00:52:02,016 --> 00:52:03,852
We're just so excited
to cheer you on.

660
00:52:03,935 --> 00:52:05,687
- Bart: Here's Wonder Woman!
- Go get him, please.

661
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,647
Here's Amy Grant!
You are like a super hero--

662
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,941
- We gotta roll. Sorry.
- What? we're hanging out.

663
00:52:10,024 --> 00:52:11,693
- Hi, guys.
- This is Mike.

664
00:52:11,776 --> 00:52:15,405
- Hey. Good luck, Bart.
- Yeah, good-- have a good one.

665
00:52:15,488 --> 00:52:17,448
- Did you see who that was?
- I did.

666
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:20,243
That was Amy Grant.
She talked to me.

667
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:42,473
Come on, Nashvi-i-lle!

668
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:45,476
Whoo! What's up, GMA?

669
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,937
Are you guys ready
to rock tonight?

670
00:52:51,107 --> 00:52:54,277
Man, we are so glad
to be here with you!

671
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,696
Ever feel like everything
in your life

672
00:52:56,779 --> 00:53:00,825
is just building and building
and building to one big moment?

673
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:04,204
That's how we feel tonight!
Let's do this!

674
00:53:17,342 --> 00:53:19,510
Whoo!

675
00:53:23,681 --> 00:53:27,268
Bart.
You're stressing me out, man.

676
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:31,814
Sorry.
It's nerves, you know.

677
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:33,900
I wish they'd hurry up.

678
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,779
I thought it was good, right?
It felt good.

679
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:39,739
- It was good.
- It was good, man.

680
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:42,575
- Best show we ever played.
- Crowd was into it, man.

681
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,663
- I'm gonna go talk to them.
- No! Hey! Hey!

682
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:49,624
- Don't do that, Bart!
- Brickell's got it.

683
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:51,584
Let him do his job.

684
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:53,795
What if he can't?

685
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:01,970
- Hey!
- Wait! Wait!

686
00:54:02,053 --> 00:54:04,055
- Dude, no!
- That's a mistake.

687
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:06,641
But if you could see
how far they've come from

688
00:54:06,724 --> 00:54:09,477
- the first time I saw 'em--
- Hey! Hey, guys!

689
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,647
Gentlemen.
Oh, and also lady.

690
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:14,357
- <i>So you guys</i> know Bart?
<i>- Nice to meet y'all.</i>

691
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,025
- Thanks for coming out tonight.
- And <i>I've</i> been getting

692
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:17,777
some good feedback
from these guys,

693
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,071
<i>- and I'm almost finished--
- Was that awesome or what?</i>

694
00:54:20,154 --> 00:54:21,364
<i>I mean, don't y'all agree?</i>

695
00:54:21,447 --> 00:54:22,615
I think we're pretty much
finished up here anyway.

696
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:25,034
Ah, come on,
I wanna know what you think!

697
00:54:25,118 --> 00:54:28,371
- Let me, let me finish up here--
- I want to know what they think.

698
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:39,841
You really wanna know?

699
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:42,969
Yeah, I do!
Come on, lay it on me.

700
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:44,846
Give me all you got,
Mr. Music Man.

701
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:48,683
- I have the skin of a rhino.
- All I got, okay.

702
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:51,519
I'm sorry to have to be
the one tell you this, kid,

703
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:56,399
but, um...
you're just not good enough.

704
00:54:56,482 --> 00:54:57,692
<i>Not yet, anyway-</i>

705
00:54:57,775 --> 00:55:01,738
What? You're wrong.

706
00:55:01,821 --> 00:55:04,866
Seventh graders at youth camp,
that's one thing, Bart.

707
00:55:04,949 --> 00:55:06,826
But this,
this is about record sales.

708
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:08,536
And I just can't sell
what you're doing up there.

709
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:10,830
Seventh gr--
we packed the house, man.

710
00:55:10,913 --> 00:55:12,790
We've been selling our
own albums for years now.

711
00:55:12,874 --> 00:55:16,544
I mean, what-- what world
are you guys living in?

712
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:18,254
Man: Reality.

713
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:22,175
Look, you need to embrace
reality, Bart.

714
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:24,052
<i>Your stuff...</i>

715
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:28,014
<i>- You're not good enough, Bart.
- Dreams don't pay the bills.</i>

716
00:55:28,097 --> 00:55:30,558
All it does...

717
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:34,312
is keep you from all this...

718
00:55:34,395 --> 00:55:36,981
<i>from knowing what's real.</i>

719
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:38,941
What about the stuff
we played at the end?

720
00:55:39,025 --> 00:55:40,401
<i>The worship music?</i>

721
00:55:40,485 --> 00:55:41,903
Oh, it was beautiful,
magical, truly.

722
00:55:41,986 --> 00:55:43,696
I've got a brother-in-law
in Denver.

723
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,073
He's looking
for a worship pastor.

724
00:55:45,156 --> 00:55:47,116
- I could put you two together.
- ls she serious?

725
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,911
It's the truth you're mad at,
not me.

726
00:55:49,994 --> 00:55:52,121
<i>My high school football team,
there were a couple of guys</i>

727
00:55:52,205 --> 00:55:55,291
that were good enough to make
a big noise in a small town.

728
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,001
<i>But that was it.
You know what?</i>

729
00:55:57,085 --> 00:55:59,587
<i>They're still there.
They're stuck.</i>

730
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,547
<i>And that's what'll happen
to you.</i>

731
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:03,424
You gotta be good
at something we can sell.

732
00:56:03,508 --> 00:56:05,134
Just stop!
Do you guys not get it?

733
00:56:05,218 --> 00:56:07,220
Okay? We've given everything
for this moment.

734
00:56:07,303 --> 00:56:09,138
There is no plan B for us. Okay?
We will do whatever it takes.

735
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:11,224
We will work harder
than anybody else.

736
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:13,267
- Tell me what you need me to do.
- Look, I work with a lot of bands,

737
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:17,021
and I can recognize who's
gonna make it and who isn't.

738
00:56:17,105 --> 00:56:20,149
And I gotta tell you the truth, Bart.
You won't.

739
00:56:20,233 --> 00:56:22,485
How dare you say that?
You don't even know me.

740
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:26,030
Go home.
That's what you should do.

741
00:56:26,114 --> 00:56:27,782
<i>- Dad, I can do this.
- No, you can't.</i>

742
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:29,450
- I can do this!
- No, you can't!

743
00:56:29,534 --> 00:56:30,952
And you're gonna blink
your eyes,

744
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:33,037
and you're gonna realize
that you're nothing,

745
00:56:33,121 --> 00:56:34,872
<i>and that life
has got you nowhere</i>

746
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:38,084
because you chased
some stupid dream!

747
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:39,210
Wake up!

748
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:40,795
- Let me finish up here.
- No!

749
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:42,880
No, I'm not leaving!
I'm not leaving!

750
00:56:42,964 --> 00:56:44,882
<i>Yes, you are.
Let me finish up.</i>

751
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:54,934
- What happened?
- What'd they say?

752
00:56:55,017 --> 00:56:57,520
Bart? You okay?

753
00:56:57,603 --> 00:56:59,689
You're not good enough, Bart.

754
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:03,484
You're not.

755
00:57:04,652 --> 00:57:07,530
<i>Well, that didn't take
very long.</i>

756
00:57:08,948 --> 00:57:10,825
Bart: <i>So what now?
What do we do now?</i>

757
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:12,577
I don't know.
Give me a second.

758
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,579
There's gotta be something
we can do. I mean...

759
00:57:14,662 --> 00:57:15,830
Just let me think for a second.

760
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:17,206
<i>You're just gonna take that
from them out there? Huh?</i>

761
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,666
<i>You're the manager.
Do you not have an idea?</i>

762
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:20,334
- Hold on.
- What is the next step?

763
00:57:20,418 --> 00:57:23,713
Sometimes there is no
next step, Bart! Okay?

764
00:57:23,796 --> 00:57:25,214
You just ticked off
half of Nashville in there.

765
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:28,426
- What's he talking about?
- You know what?

766
00:57:28,509 --> 00:57:30,803
If this is all there is...

767
00:57:30,887 --> 00:57:32,263
then I'm done.

768
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,515
- What?
- Then I quit.

769
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:35,808
- What?
- Wow, really?

770
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:37,560
- Classy.
- What about us?

771
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:40,021
- What about the band?
- What band, Mike?

772
00:57:40,104 --> 00:57:42,940
What about it?
They hated it.

773
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:44,901
They hated all of it.
They hated us.

774
00:57:47,695 --> 00:57:49,238
I'm done.

775
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:51,949
Sorry to disappoint.

776
00:57:57,455 --> 00:58:01,209
Can I come in, or you wanna sulk
a little longer?

777
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:09,091
$0...

778
00:58:11,552 --> 00:58:15,681
You just gonna quit?
ls that it?

779
00:58:15,765 --> 00:58:17,808
You got a better idea?

780
00:58:17,892 --> 00:58:21,521
I'm tired, man. I'm--

781
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:23,231
<i>I got nothing left.</i>

782
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:27,985
I'm gonna be honest with you,
like I told you I would be.

783
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:30,279
Sometimes
when you're up there,

784
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:32,782
it's like you're singing
somebody else's music.

785
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:34,408
It's like a fake imitation.

786
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:36,911
I don't believe it.
I don't believe you.

787
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,833
Well, this has gone
from bad to worse, thank you.

788
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:45,503
But then there're times...

789
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:47,547
when I see something real.

790
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,924
I see something authentic.

791
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:56,889
But as soon as it shows up,
it's like you're afraid, and--

792
00:58:56,973 --> 00:59:00,935
and then it vanishes
just as quick as it came.

793
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:03,771
<i>And that's what makes you
a puzzle to me.</i>

794
00:59:03,854 --> 00:59:06,524
Let me ask you something,
Bart.

795
00:59:06,607 --> 00:59:08,192
<i>What're you running from?</i>

796
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:12,822
My dad.

797
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:19,620
He, uh--

798
00:59:19,704 --> 00:59:20,955
he--

799
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:23,124
<i>He beat you, didn't he?</i>

800
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:25,626
You ain't got
no poker face, kid.

801
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,796
And I carry that.
I have to live with that.

802
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:31,549
You know?
I always will.

803
00:59:31,632 --> 00:59:33,050
<i>Then write about it.</i>

804
00:59:34,552 --> 00:59:37,096
Stop running from it.

805
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:41,225
Let that pain
become your inspiration.

806
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:44,979
<i>And then you'll have something
that people can believe in.</i>

807
00:59:45,062 --> 00:59:48,608
<i>But to do that, you got to face
your fears, son.</i>

808
00:59:52,653 --> 00:59:53,946
You know, Bart...

809
00:59:55,865 --> 00:59:58,743
I may not always believe
in your music,

810
00:59:58,826 --> 01:00:00,119
but I do believe in you.

811
01:00:00,202 --> 01:00:02,872
You sold me, kid.

812
01:00:02,955 --> 01:00:04,874
Don't quit.

813
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:21,766
Hey, guys, uh...

814
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:28,606
I'm sorry.

815
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:36,155
Um... there's some things
I need to take care of.

816
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:40,117
Some stuff
I need to sort out.

817
01:00:44,664 --> 01:00:45,998
I gotta go home.

818
01:00:54,298 --> 01:00:57,259
But I'd really, really like it
if you guys would wait for me.

819
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,139
So we're still a band?

820
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:05,643
No, uh, we're a family.

821
01:01:05,726 --> 01:01:07,269
Okay.

822
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:17,655
Bart: The band continued east,
and <i>I</i> headed back west

823
01:01:17,738 --> 01:01:19,407
<i>hoping they would wait on me.</i>

824
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:24,078
<i>I knew I needed to deal
with things at home.</i>

825
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:28,207
<i>I</i> needed to face the pain,
but the closer <i>I</i> got,

826
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:32,878
<i>the only thing I felt
was... dread.</i>

827
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:05,953
I can't do this.

828
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:12,251
Hey, Bart.

829
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:15,838
Are you hungry?

830
01:02:18,215 --> 01:02:21,177
I, uh-- I heard you
come in last night,

831
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:26,182
so, I made some bacon
and, uh, cinnamon rolls

832
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:31,145
and... a-a frittata, which I
just learned how to make.

833
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,190
When did you learn how to cook?

834
01:02:34,273 --> 01:02:36,859
Oh, I been learning
a lot lately.

835
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:41,447
Why don't you go on in there?
I-l set the table.

836
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:45,159
Go on.

837
01:02:47,828 --> 01:02:49,246
Here.

838
01:02:56,212 --> 01:03:02,009
The key to the frittata
is how hot you make the pan.

839
01:03:04,178 --> 01:03:05,596
That's the secret.

840
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:12,603
Go on and sit down.

841
01:03:15,898 --> 01:03:18,150
Take that one.
Yeah, go ahead.

842
01:03:21,612 --> 01:03:23,030
Want some bacon?

843
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:33,249
Well, uh-- wanna say grace?

844
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:36,126
What?

845
01:03:37,878 --> 01:03:39,213
I'll do it.

846
01:03:41,882 --> 01:03:45,469
God, it's me here, Arthur.

847
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:51,350
I wanna thank you
for, uh, answering my prayer.

848
01:03:52,893 --> 01:03:54,186
And, uh...

849
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:57,565
rub-a-dub-dub,
and thanks for the grub.

850
01:03:57,648 --> 01:03:58,983
Amen.

851
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:16,417
So you f--
found God or something?

852
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,795
Well, I-l been listening
to some preachers on the radio

853
01:04:19,879 --> 01:04:24,842
and, uh, re-- uh,
reading the Bible and whatnot.

854
01:04:24,925 --> 01:04:25,926
What part?

855
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,220
All 0f it.

856
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:32,266
And, uh, couple of times,
actually.

857
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:35,811
And, uh,
it's pretty confusing.

858
01:04:35,895 --> 01:04:39,106
<i>It's-- like Leviticus.</i>

859
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:45,738
What is that?
I-I-I don't get it.

860
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:47,239
What Prayer?

861
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:51,285
You said God answered a prayer.
What prayer?

862
01:04:51,368 --> 01:04:54,121
Just seeing you again.

863
01:04:55,789 --> 01:04:58,334
Well, Dad, I been busy.

864
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:01,754
Yeah.

865
01:05:01,837 --> 01:05:04,965
I guess you noticed
I've got a few projects

866
01:05:05,049 --> 01:05:06,592
going on around here.

867
01:05:06,675 --> 01:05:08,636
And I got one
out in the garage

868
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:10,471
I was hoping
that you'd help me with.

869
01:05:10,554 --> 01:05:16,060
Uh-- I been, uh,
rebuilding that Jeep of mine.

870
01:05:16,143 --> 01:05:18,896
And, man, when I was your age,

871
01:05:18,979 --> 01:05:21,106
I made some memories
in that Jeep.

872
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:25,361
And I was hoping
that maybe we could, uh,

873
01:05:25,444 --> 01:05:29,239
get it running again and...
I don't know...

874
01:05:30,741 --> 01:05:32,201
- Go somewhere, do some--
- What're you doing?

875
01:05:32,284 --> 01:05:35,704
What is this?

876
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:41,168
Well, I-I-I wrote you
some letters.

877
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:42,378
Did you get 'em?

878
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:45,047
Yeah. Threw 'em away.

879
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,758
Did you read 'em?

880
01:05:47,841 --> 01:05:49,051
<i>Nope.</i>

881
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,055
Oh.

882
01:05:54,974 --> 01:05:57,309
I thought that's why
you came back last night.

883
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,814
L'm-- well...

884
01:06:01,897 --> 01:06:04,274
I was just trying to make
a memory, that's all.

885
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:06,902
That's kind of hard
for me to do, Dad.

886
01:06:06,986 --> 01:06:09,863
'Cause all the memories
that we have together are bad.

887
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:13,283
Uh, do you want some--
I'll get some ketchup.

888
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:25,462
Son, I-l know that
I-l did some things that--

889
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:27,798
<i>Bart".
You did some things?</i>

890
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:30,634
I got a memory for you,
Dad.

891
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,888
That night you beat me
so badly

892
01:06:34,972 --> 01:06:38,058
that I had to sleep on my
stomach 'cause I was so bruised?

893
01:06:39,143 --> 01:06:40,477
I couldn't move.

894
01:06:42,187 --> 01:06:44,773
<i>What was I, ten? 11?</i>

895
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:49,695
Yeah, I remember that.

896
01:06:51,905 --> 01:06:55,659
That, uh...
that tore me up.

897
01:06:55,743 --> 01:06:59,121
L-I cried that-- all night
about what I did to you then.

898
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:01,415
<i>Bart".
I cried too, Dad.</i>

899
01:07:01,498 --> 01:07:04,793
In pain all night.

900
01:07:07,379 --> 01:07:08,797
Why were you?

901
01:07:12,509 --> 01:07:14,803
And now you just wanna
come back in here?

902
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:16,263
Make breakfast?

903
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:17,556
Pretend like nothing
everhappened?

904
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,641
It doesn't work that way, Dad!

905
01:07:23,812 --> 01:07:27,441
What am I gonna do, Bart?
I-l just--

906
01:07:27,524 --> 01:07:31,278
I wanna make things right
with you and me.

907
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,780
And, um...

908
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:36,950
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

909
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:41,455
<i>I don't know how to do it.
I'm trying.</i>

910
01:07:41,538 --> 01:07:44,708
I'm reading a lot of books
I don't understand, and I'm--

911
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:51,715
I just got a lot of questions
about myself.

912
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:53,759
<i>I don 't have nobody</i> to...

913
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,889
<i>to answer 'em for me.</i>

914
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:08,357
If God can forgive
everybody else...

915
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,526
why can't He forgive me?

916
01:08:18,242 --> 01:08:20,244
God can forgive you.

917
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:24,498
I can't.

918
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:30,712
I can't believe
I came back here.

919
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:33,215
- Can't you give me a chance?
- No!

920
01:08:35,175 --> 01:08:39,012
You've just gotta give up
on that dream, Dad.

921
01:08:39,096 --> 01:08:43,350
'Cause it keeps you from this.
From knowing what's real.

922
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,430
Do it.

923
01:10:45,514 --> 01:10:46,932
Go ahead.

924
01:10:49,142 --> 01:10:50,727
Just do it.

925
01:11:42,988 --> 01:11:44,740
Dad, are you dying?

926
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:55,751
Yeah.

927
01:12:06,136 --> 01:12:07,596
I can show you, Dad.

928
01:12:10,724 --> 01:12:13,393
With your questions,
I can show you how.

929
01:12:41,129 --> 01:12:43,382
<i>Pastor:
So if you didn't bring your journals,</i>

930
01:12:43,465 --> 01:12:44,883
<i>come up here.</i>

931
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:47,177
<i>You're gonna need them
for your session tonight.</i>

932
01:12:52,933 --> 01:12:56,395
<i>Tonight we're gonna talk
about forgiveness.</i>

933
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:59,689
<i>So find</i> a <i>blank page in your journal,</i>

934
01:12:59,773 --> 01:13:02,067
<i>and I want you to write these words--</i>

935
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:07,280
"God, tonight I choose to forgive,"

936
01:13:07,364 --> 01:13:09,324
<i>and I want you to finish that sentence.</i>

937
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:12,119
<i>Now, you may say to me,</i>

938
01:13:12,202 --> 01:13:16,206
<i>"You don't know how hard it is for me
to forgive this person.</i>

939
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:18,625
<i>You don't know what they've done to me."</i>

940
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:22,045
And I'd say, "I know it's hard.

941
01:13:23,505 --> 01:13:25,966
<i>But if you have been forgiven by God,</i>

942
01:13:26,049 --> 01:13:28,677
<i>then he gives you the power
to forgive others."</i>

943
01:13:58,582 --> 01:14:00,709
Better late than never.

944
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:05,672
I'll get the door.

945
01:14:12,846 --> 01:14:15,891
Man: <i>We got</i> a <i>special treat
for you this morning.</i>

946
01:14:17,517 --> 01:14:20,687
<i>Any of y'all heard the story
of John Newton?</i>

947
01:14:21,938 --> 01:14:24,524
He was a sea captain.

948
01:14:24,608 --> 01:14:26,485
Slave trader.

949
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:29,070
<i>He was tormented and racked</i>

950
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:32,199
<i>with guilt and shame.</i>

951
01:14:32,282 --> 01:14:34,242
<i>Well, he found for forgiveness.</i>

952
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:37,287
<i>He found Christ.</i>

953
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:40,624
<i>He wrote a little song about that</i>

954
01:14:40,707 --> 01:14:43,543
<i>called "Amazing Grace."</i>

955
01:14:43,627 --> 01:14:45,712
<i>That song touched the world.</i>

956
01:14:45,795 --> 01:14:47,589
<i>- Hey.
- What?</i>

957
01:14:47,672 --> 01:14:50,091
I figured out why you like junk.

958
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:52,719
- What?
- Why you like to fix things.

959
01:14:52,802 --> 01:14:54,554
Why you--

960
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:57,224
you make something
out of nothing all the time.

961
01:14:58,058 --> 01:15:01,686
They got a word for that.

962
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:05,440
- What's that <i>word?</i>
- It's "redemption."

963
01:15:05,524 --> 01:15:07,067
Redemption.

964
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:09,528
Yeah. Hey.

965
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:11,905
What is-- what is this note here?

966
01:15:11,988 --> 01:15:14,115
Right there.
What is that note?

967
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:16,076
- G.
- Yeah.

968
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,245
- What's that note?
- C.

969
01:15:18,328 --> 01:15:19,746
- C, all right.
- G to C.

970
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:22,541
You got some competition now, boy.

971
01:15:22,624 --> 01:15:25,001
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

972
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:43,979
<i>Man on 'N: Bart Millard!</i>

973
01:15:45,272 --> 01:15:47,440
You gotta hold still, Dad.

974
01:15:47,524 --> 01:15:50,485
- Oh, sorry.
- <i>It's</i> okay.

975
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:55,448
Arthur: Oh, <i>I</i> wanted to be there.

976
01:15:55,532 --> 01:15:57,742
- That's all right, Dad.
- Ahh.

977
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:00,704
Hey, there's Shannon.

978
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:06,376
<i>Boy, you better hang onto that girl.</i>

979
01:16:06,459 --> 01:16:09,004
Don't you ever let her get away.

980
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,590
Dad, we're not-- we're not dating anymore.

981
01:16:11,673 --> 01:16:14,509
<i>What? What?</i>

982
01:16:14,593 --> 01:16:15,969
<i>What'd you do?</i>

983
01:16:16,052 --> 01:16:18,305
You two are meant for each other.

984
01:16:18,388 --> 01:16:20,640
<i>Whatever you did,</i>

985
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:23,852
even if you don't know what you did,
you're wrong.

986
01:16:26,062 --> 01:16:28,607
Did I ever tell you how I met your mom?

987
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,903
Tell me.

988
01:16:33,987 --> 01:16:36,489
Hey, <i>this</i> is Shannon.

989
01:16:36,573 --> 01:16:38,325
Leave a message.

990
01:16:38,408 --> 01:16:40,910
<i>Bart: Hey, Shannon.</i>

991
01:16:40,994 --> 01:16:43,288
<i>I don't know if you're getting
these messages or not,</i>

992
01:16:43,371 --> 01:16:46,791
<i>but I just wanted you to know
that I'm-- I'm back home,</i>

993
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:49,919
<i>and I'm-- I'm journaling again.</i>

994
01:16:50,003 --> 01:16:53,965
<i>I'm writing a lot like we did
when we were kids.</i>

995
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:55,925
<i>It feels really good.</i>

996
01:17:58,321 --> 01:18:00,156
I love you, boy.

997
01:18:16,798 --> 01:18:19,175
I was listening, Bart.

998
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,054
<i>I was listening to you.</i>

999
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,392
On the radio.

1000
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:32,647
<i>'Cause you'd sing...</i>

1001
01:18:32,731 --> 01:18:35,233
<i>and I'd listen to every word.</i>

1002
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:37,902
And then...

1003
01:18:37,986 --> 01:18:39,529
<i>you'd finish.</i>

1004
01:18:39,612 --> 01:18:43,825
<i>And then I'd listen to what they were
talking about there at church.</i>

1005
01:18:43,908 --> 01:18:45,952
<i>That's what saved me.</i>

1006
01:18:48,663 --> 01:18:51,207
<i>I was real proud of you.</i>

1007
01:18:53,877 --> 01:18:55,920
<i>Was real proud.</i>

1008
01:18:57,589 --> 01:19:01,176
<i>I told you not to follow your dreams.</i>

1009
01:19:02,552 --> 01:19:05,555
<i>But that's only because mine,</i>

1010
01:19:05,638 --> 01:19:07,849
<i>they never came true.</i>

1011
01:19:08,892 --> 01:19:10,852
<i>But you're not me.</i>

1012
01:19:13,605 --> 01:19:15,523
You're not like me.

1013
01:19:17,567 --> 01:19:19,027
Unh-unh.

1014
01:19:21,905 --> 01:19:24,240
And you, you have a gift.

1015
01:19:25,909 --> 01:19:27,911
A real gift.

1016
01:19:29,829 --> 01:19:31,956
I wanna take care of you, Bart.

1017
01:19:32,957 --> 01:19:36,169
I got something for you, Bart.

1018
01:19:36,252 --> 01:19:37,879
Here.

1019
01:19:37,962 --> 01:19:40,131
L want, uh...

1020
01:19:41,883 --> 01:19:45,470
I never made much money.

1021
01:19:45,553 --> 01:19:48,139
<i>But I have my life insurance.</i>

1022
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:53,603
<i>And I-- I tried to save
everything I could.</i>

1023
01:19:55,939 --> 01:19:58,983
And I want you to have that...

1024
01:19:59,067 --> 01:20:03,154
so you can pay attention to your singing.

1025
01:20:04,572 --> 01:20:07,700
And you'll get a check every month

1026
01:20:07,784 --> 01:20:10,286
so you can go chase your dream.

1027
01:20:12,956 --> 01:20:15,917
And I want you to catch it.

1028
01:20:17,961 --> 01:20:19,420
Hmm?

1029
01:20:20,588 --> 01:20:22,507
Don't you ever look back.

1030
01:20:25,134 --> 01:20:26,970
<i>You promise?</i>

1031
01:20:27,971 --> 01:20:29,556
I promise.

1032
01:20:31,683 --> 01:20:34,102
Will you sing a song, son?

1033
01:20:35,979 --> 01:20:37,939
L'm sleepy-

1034
01:20:41,067 --> 01:20:42,902
Sing.

1035
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:30,283
<i>Hseel'</i>

1036
01:22:18,414 --> 01:22:20,875
Imagine what he's seeing up there, Bart.

1037
01:22:20,959 --> 01:22:22,543
Just imagine.

1038
01:22:59,084 --> 01:23:01,045
- Welcome back, man.
- Thanks, man.

1039
01:23:01,128 --> 01:23:03,172
Yeah.

1040
01:23:03,255 --> 01:23:05,257
Where we going?

1041
01:23:05,341 --> 01:23:07,635
West. Couple gigs in New Mexico.

1042
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:49,898
Okay, God.

1043
01:24:51,274 --> 01:24:52,693
Okay.

1044
01:25:36,153 --> 01:25:39,030
<i>Bart".
Thank you! Thank you.</i>

1045
01:25:39,114 --> 01:25:40,240
<i>It's good to be back.</i>

1046
01:25:40,323 --> 01:25:42,200
Man, I, uh...

1047
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:45,120
<i>I haven't been on stage
since I lost my dad.</i>

1048
01:25:45,203 --> 01:25:47,914
<i>And, uh, I'm learning to deal with it.</i>

1049
01:25:47,998 --> 01:25:50,625
And I deal with it
the only way I know how,

1050
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:52,210
and that's to write a song.

1051
01:25:52,294 --> 01:25:54,171
And I'm gonna--

1052
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:00,260
<i>Well, I'm gonna sing it for you now.</i>

1053
01:26:00,343 --> 01:26:02,262
<i>This is called "I Can Only Imagine."</i>

1054
01:26:51,102 --> 01:26:52,771
That kid wrote this?

1055
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:55,857
Yeah, he did.

1056
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:58,360
Wow.

1057
01:26:58,443 --> 01:27:00,487
I know.

1058
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:02,614
I can't stop listening to it.

1059
01:27:03,573 --> 01:27:05,367
I'm gonna start pitching it around town.

1060
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:08,078
I know who you need to send it to.

1061
01:27:12,624 --> 01:27:14,501
Phone!

1062
01:27:14,584 --> 01:27:16,670
Jim, get it. You're right there.

1063
01:27:18,213 --> 01:27:20,257
Phone!

1064
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,008
Seriously?

1065
01:27:22,092 --> 01:27:24,594
Phone!! No, man, I got it.
It's cool. No, I got it.

1066
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:26,221
- You look really--
- No, I got it! Let it go, let it--

1067
01:27:26,304 --> 01:27:27,973
Okay, thanks, man, appreciate it.

1068
01:27:28,056 --> 01:27:29,474
Hello?

1069
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:32,894
Who is this?

1070
01:27:34,813 --> 01:27:36,606
Sure. Yeah, hold on.

1071
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:37,899
Let me get him.

1072
01:27:38,817 --> 01:27:41,319
Bart, phone's for you.

1073
01:27:41,403 --> 01:27:42,654
<i>Bart!</i>

1074
01:27:46,283 --> 01:27:47,534
Hello?

1075
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:51,913
Yeah, right.
Good one, guys, Real good joke.

1076
01:27:51,997 --> 01:27:54,207
Whose idea was that? Amy Grant.

1077
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:56,126
Uh, that-- that was her, man.

1078
01:27:56,209 --> 01:27:59,421
That-- that was Amy Grant
you hung up on.

1079
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:01,047
- Are you serious? Give me the phone!
- Yeah, that happened.

1080
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:04,801
- Any? Hello? Hello?
- Actual Amy Grant?

1081
01:28:04,885 --> 01:28:06,761
- Jim, how do I re-dial?
- It's a rotary phone, Bart.

1082
01:28:06,845 --> 01:28:08,847
- There's gotta be a way to redial.
- Call her back.

1083
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:11,391
How do I get in--

1084
01:28:15,478 --> 01:28:17,397
Hey, Amy-

1085
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,860
Amy: <i>Bart... you didn't write
this song in ten minutes.</i>

1086
01:28:22,694 --> 01:28:24,863
<i>It took a lifetime.</i>

1087
01:28:24,946 --> 01:28:27,657
<i>Scott gave me a Imagine when I was</i>

1088
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:30,911
dealing with a friend losing a battle,
you know?

1089
01:28:30,994 --> 01:28:33,038
And it got me through.

1090
01:28:33,121 --> 01:28:34,915
I couldn't stop listening.

1091
01:28:34,998 --> 01:28:37,834
I mean, it's a career-maker.

1092
01:28:37,918 --> 01:28:40,795
And I know some songs
can be real personal.

1093
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:43,798
<i>Is this what you really want?</i>

1094
01:28:51,765 --> 01:28:55,185
You know,
I've never told anybody my story.

1095
01:29:00,523 --> 01:29:02,984
My dad was a monster.

1096
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:06,988
I mean, that's the only word for it.

1097
01:29:08,531 --> 01:29:12,953
And I saw God transform him

1098
01:29:13,036 --> 01:29:15,580
from a man that I hated

1099
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:17,666
into the man I wanted to become...

1100
01:29:19,542 --> 01:29:21,544
into my best friend.

1101
01:29:24,339 --> 01:29:27,175
And I didn't realize it soon enough.

1102
01:29:27,258 --> 01:29:29,594
I guess that I didn't think
that God could do that.

1103
01:29:33,556 --> 01:29:35,350
And so I wrote this song.

1104
01:29:36,726 --> 01:29:39,479
And I want as many people
as possible to hear it.

1105
01:29:41,356 --> 01:29:43,108
And you can do that.

1106
01:29:45,902 --> 01:29:47,612
I can't.

1107
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:51,282
<i>So...</i>

1108
01:29:52,283 --> 01:29:54,411
Yes.

1109
01:29:54,494 --> 01:29:56,204
This is what I want.

1110
01:29:58,581 --> 01:30:02,210
So, Brick, you know us.

1111
01:30:02,293 --> 01:30:04,295
We lay our cards on the table.

1112
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:08,675
Amy needs a comeback song.
We believe this is it.

1113
01:30:08,758 --> 01:30:11,302
<i>Amy is doing a homecoming date</i>

1114
01:30:11,386 --> 01:30:13,430
<i>here in Nashville
to kick off a fall tour.</i>

1115
01:30:13,513 --> 01:30:16,891
<i>We'd like to showcase it there.</i>

1116
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,818
<i>Hey, this is Shannon.
Leave a message.</i>

1117
01:30:26,901 --> 01:30:28,778
Hey, Shannon, um...

1118
01:30:28,862 --> 01:30:30,739
<i>I just wanted to call you
and let you know,</i>

1119
01:30:30,822 --> 01:30:34,284
<i>uh, I wrote a new song.</i>

1120
01:30:34,367 --> 01:30:37,662
It feels different than anything
I've written before.

1121
01:30:37,746 --> 01:30:39,873
<i>Um... I think it might be--</i>

1122
01:30:39,956 --> 01:30:42,208
<i>might be something special.</i>

1123
01:30:42,292 --> 01:30:43,918
<i>Um...</i>

1124
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:49,466
Shannon, I'm sorry I hurt you.

1125
01:30:49,549 --> 01:30:52,552
<i>I know I hurt you over and over
and over again,</i>

1126
01:30:52,635 --> 01:30:55,013
<i>and I-- I'm sorry.</i>

1127
01:30:55,096 --> 01:30:58,850
I just...
It had nothing to do with you.

1128
01:31:00,393 --> 01:31:02,562
It never did.
It had nothing to do with you.

1129
01:31:02,645 --> 01:31:04,105
L just...

1130
01:31:06,316 --> 01:31:07,692
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1131
01:31:11,362 --> 01:31:12,614
Hello?

1132
01:31:36,638 --> 01:31:38,056
Beautiful, isn't it?

1133
01:31:41,559 --> 01:31:44,687
I can't think of a better place
to unveil "lmagine."

1134
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:47,607
I hope I can do it justice.

1135
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:49,567
It's gonna be something.

1136
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:51,736
Mm-hmm.

1137
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,988
When do you record it?

1138
01:31:54,072 --> 01:31:55,448
Soon.

1139
01:31:55,532 --> 01:31:58,451
Just gotta find that sound.

1140
01:31:58,535 --> 01:32:00,703
I've listened to your tape 1,000 times.

1141
01:32:00,787 --> 01:32:03,206
Well, thank you.

1142
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:09,420
Is there anything you want me to say

1143
01:32:09,504 --> 01:32:11,714
after I sing it?

1144
01:32:14,884 --> 01:32:17,178
Tell 'em I wrote it for my dad.

1145
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:57,886
Did you send one to DJC
in Birmingham?

1146
01:32:57,969 --> 01:32:59,762
Okay, bribe him with chocolate.

1147
01:32:59,846 --> 01:33:02,140
Actually, Snickers bars,
he loves 'em, okay?

1148
01:33:02,223 --> 01:33:04,726
- <i>Yeah.</i> I <i>got</i> it.
<i>- And you put on there</i>

1149
01:33:04,809 --> 01:33:06,769
"From the writers of
'I Can Only Imagine .

1150
01:33:06,853 --> 01:33:08,938
Yeah, yeah, I've got 'em. 200 copies.

1151
01:33:09,022 --> 01:33:10,106
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1152
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,692
Hey, uh, delivery truck just got here.
So I'll load 'em up.

1153
01:33:12,775 --> 01:33:13,985
All right, good. Okay.

1154
01:33:35,757 --> 01:33:37,717
Thank you.

1155
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,470
Thank you so much.

1156
01:33:40,553 --> 01:33:44,265
This next song is really
something special.

1157
01:33:44,349 --> 01:33:48,519
See, I found a song
that saved me through a time.

1158
01:33:48,603 --> 01:33:52,523
You <i>know</i> how <i>music</i> does that?

1159
01:33:52,607 --> 01:33:54,150
<i>See I was, um...</i>

1160
01:33:54,234 --> 01:33:57,987
I was dealing with loss, with pain.

1161
01:33:58,071 --> 01:34:00,615
And I heard this song,

1162
01:34:00,698 --> 01:34:04,118
and it just blew my soul wide open.

1163
01:34:04,202 --> 01:34:08,122
It lifted me up. It rescued me.

1164
01:34:10,166 --> 01:34:12,752
And you're the first ones to ever hear it.

1165
01:34:12,835 --> 01:34:15,171
This is "I Can Only lmagine."

1166
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:51,165
Bart, would you come up here, please?

1167
01:34:51,249 --> 01:34:54,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
the writer of the song is here tonight,

1168
01:34:54,544 --> 01:34:57,046
and I want y'all to meet him.

1169
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,217
<i>Bart, come on up.</i>

1170
01:35:01,301 --> 01:35:04,178
I'm not joking, come on up!

1171
01:35:18,318 --> 01:35:21,321
It's not just the song that's special.

1172
01:35:21,404 --> 01:35:23,114
It's you.

1173
01:35:23,197 --> 01:35:26,409
And this story is not my story.

1174
01:35:26,492 --> 01:35:28,119
It's yours.

1175
01:35:28,202 --> 01:35:32,832
And this moment,
it doesn't belong to me.

1176
01:35:32,915 --> 01:35:34,500
It belongs to you.

1177
01:35:35,668 --> 01:35:36,836
Take it.

1178
01:35:40,381 --> 01:35:44,552
Bart Millard wrote this song,
this beautiful song,

1179
01:35:44,635 --> 01:35:46,846
and want him to be the one
to sing it for y'all tonight

1180
01:35:46,929 --> 01:35:48,723
for the first time ever.

1181
01:35:48,806 --> 01:35:50,391
<i>Ban?</i>

1182
01:36:03,154 --> 01:36:04,864
This is for my dad.

1183
01:41:36,529 --> 01:41:37,822
<i>Amy: Wasn't that great?</i>

1184
01:41:37,905 --> 01:41:41,909
Bart and his band MercyMe will be
releasing that song as their first single,

1185
01:41:41,992 --> 01:41:45,079
<i>and I want all y'all to keep
an eye out for it, okay?</i>

1186
01:41:51,293 --> 01:41:52,378
Shannon!

1187
01:42:11,105 --> 01:42:13,107
Bart:
<i>It's</i> always been you.

1188
01:42:13,190 --> 01:42:15,651
- I've always loved you.
- I know.

1189
01:42:16,986 --> 01:42:19,071
Excuse me, sir.
I hate to be rude.

1190
01:42:19,155 --> 01:42:21,240
This is an emergency.
I-l, I promise.

1191
01:42:21,323 --> 01:42:22,783
I promise, 'Kay?

1192
01:42:26,829 --> 01:42:27,955
Come on, Jim.

1193
01:42:29,206 --> 01:42:31,000
- Hello?
- Hey, stop the truck.

1194
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:32,543
- What?
- <i>You have to stop the truck.</i>

1195
01:42:32,626 --> 01:42:34,503
Amy's giving the song back to us.

1196
01:42:34,587 --> 01:42:36,088
<i>She's giving us Imagine.</i>

1197
01:42:36,172 --> 01:42:38,174
<i>Imagine is going out as our first single.</i>

1198
01:42:38,257 --> 01:42:39,717
- Stop the truck!
- Why?

1199
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,719
Amy's giving it back!
Stop staring at me!

1200
01:42:41,802 --> 01:42:43,554
Stop the truck!

1201
01:43:06,744 --> 01:43:10,372
Man <i>on radio: Here's a new song

1207

<i>Woman: This song already means
so much to so many people.</i>

1208
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,811
This is MercyMe,
it's called "I Can Only lmagine."

1209
01:43:31,894 --> 01:43:33,479
Man <i>on radio: It's the number one

1220
01:45:06,572 --> 01:45:07,865
Man #2: Bart!

1221
01:45:07,948 --> 01:45:10,910
Bart: <i>If anybody I went to high school
with is listening,</i>

1222
01:45:10,993 --> 01:45:12,244
<i>I made it!</i>

1223
01:45:13,662 --> 01:45:15,289
"I Can Only lmagine," the song,

1224
01:45:15,372 --> 01:45:19,126
was written after my father passed away
with cancer many years ago.

1225
01:45:19,209 --> 01:45:21,670
He was abusive most of my-- my life.

1226
01:45:21,754 --> 01:45:23,547
If he had a bad day, he took it out on me.

1227
01:45:23,631 --> 01:45:26,008
And he was diagnosed with cancer
when I was in high school.

1228
01:45:26,091 --> 01:45:29,136
<i>I saw Jesus change him completely.</i>

1229
01:45:29,219 --> 01:45:30,888
<i>He went from a monster to being a man,</i>

1230
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:33,390
<i>that was desperately
and passionately in love with Jesus.</i>

1231
01:45:33,474 --> 01:45:36,101
<i>And it kind of set me on
this warpath for the Gospel.</i>

1232
01:45:36,185 --> 01:45:38,812
<i>'Cause if the Gospel
can change that dude,</i>

1233
01:45:38,896 --> 01:45:40,814
<i>the Gospel can change anybody,
you know?</i>
