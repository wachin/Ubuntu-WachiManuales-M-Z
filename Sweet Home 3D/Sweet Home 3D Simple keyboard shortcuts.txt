I think it would be very effective to use "single key shortcuts" for the key features, for example...

- select: "s"
- draw wall "w"
- create room "r"
- dimension tool "d"
- move "m"
- zoom in numpad "+"
- zoom out numpad "-"
- text "t"

This would allow to switch between the modes with one single key, instead of hitting ctrl + shift + key.
