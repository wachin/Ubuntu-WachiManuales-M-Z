https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16607003/qmake-could-not-find-a-qt-installation-of

I had this problem building jasmine-headless-webkit Ruby gem. Despite having qt4 installed, qmake (a symlink to qtchooser) insisted it didn't know about a QT installation. OTOH, it was able to list qt4 when asked directly.

This made everything better:

export QT_SELECT=qt4

para mi es 

export QT_SELECT=qt5
