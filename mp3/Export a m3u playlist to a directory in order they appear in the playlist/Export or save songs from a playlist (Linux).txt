Export or save songs from a playlist (Linux)
Posted on Sat 14 July 2012
I often need to export a playlist items for saving them in a USB or just in a folder. Found this useful one line command for Terminal which exports or saves a play-list items as files.

Export your playlist to a m3u file. I called it playlist.m3u
Open a terminal in the folder where you have saved the file.

Copy & paste this:
sed "s/#.*//g" < playlist.m3u | sed "/^$/d" | while read line; do cp "${line}" '/path/to/output/folder/'; done

Remember to change the path to your desired output folder.
Note: Terminal will not give any output whilst files are copied, just be patient ;)
