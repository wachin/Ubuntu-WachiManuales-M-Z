Well, OK, assuming that the files listed in the m3u playlist exist in your filesystem, this would do the work:
1) Open a terminal and cd to the directory of the playlist, then create with nano the file copy_playlist and make it executable with chmod. In it, place:
Code: [View]
#!/bin/bash
grep -v "\#" YOUR_PLAYLIST_HERE.m3u > temp_file
for i in $(cat temp_file); do
cp "$i" /HERE/THE/DESTINATION/DIRECTORY/FOR/THE/SOUND/FILES
done
rm temp_file
Then execute the file by giving ./copy_playlist
This worked fine with a m3u playlist I made with VLC media player.

Hope I helped.

If you are not experienced with terminal, please post back to explain you better.

Its says the files are not found.

When I checked I think the problem is the spaces for eg.
Code: [View]
#Instead of ../../../media/Storage/Vault/Others/Breaking Benjamin/Dear Agony
# Its tries to copy 
cp: cannot stat `Benjamin/Dear': No such file or directory

The .m3u was generated by banshee

This should work:
Code: [View]
#!/bin/bash
grep -v "\#" YOUR_PLAYLIST_HERE > temp_file
lines=$(wc -l  < temp_file)
for ((b=1;b<=$lines;b++)); do
sound_file=$(sed -n "${b}p;${b}q" temp_file);
cp "$sound_file" /PREFERABLE_DIRECTORY
done
rm temp_file

Thanx man works great.

Made a small (almost insignificant) change,  now it just asks for the playlist file and export folder  instead of editing the bash script for anyone who wants to use it in the future

Code: [View]
#!/bin/bash
grep -v "\#" "$1" > temp_file
lines=$(wc -l  < temp_file)
for ((b=1;b<=$lines;b++)); do
sound_file=$(sed -n "${b}p;${b}q" temp_file);
cp -v "$sound_file" "$2"
done
rm temp_file
Thanks Again.
