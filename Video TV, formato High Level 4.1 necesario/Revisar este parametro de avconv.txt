It surprises me that the Chromecast can't play a video with lower level specificationsâ€¦ but anyway, you can try an app like this H.264 level editor to change the file headers. It'll make your video bitstream appear to be a different level than it actually is. I'm not aware of a *nix counterpart, but you could always change the bytes themselves.

If it doesn't work, you need to re-code the video, unfortunately.

avconv -i input.mp4 -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.1 -crf 21 output.mp4

See this guide for a little more info. The CRF controls the quality. Less is better and anything between 18 and 28 is reasonable. For re-encoding, you'll probably want to be on the lower side.
